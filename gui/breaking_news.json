      "title": "Dell RecoverPoint Zero-Day Exploited by China-Linked APT Since Mid-2024",
      "date": "2026-02-18T12:15:46Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A suspected China-linked APT group (UNC6201) exploited a critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2026-22769) in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines starting in mid-2024. The flaw, rated CVSS 10.0, stems from hard-coded credentials enabling unauthenticated lateral movement and persistence. According to Mandiant and Google GTIG, attackers deployed malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and GRIMBOLT to maintain long-term access and evade detection using techniques like 'ghost NICs'.\n\nParagraph 2: This campaign impacts enterprise customers relying on Dell RecoverPoint for backup and disaster recovery—critical infrastructure for financial, healthcare, and government sectors. The prolonged zero-day exploitation (over 18 months) before disclosure underscores severe supply chain risks in enterprise data protection tools and highlights how attackers can embed persistent backdoors deep within infrastructure software.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Notepad++ patched a critical flaw (CVE-2026-25926) after an APT group linked to China compromised its hosting provider’s infrastructure to intercept and redirect update traffic to malicious servers. The attack did not exploit code vulnerabilities in Notepad++ itself but leveraged infrastructure-level compromise to selectively deliver malware to targeted users. The maintainer confirmed the attack occurred before reaching end users, with the compromise occurring upstream at the hosting level.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain attack affects millions of Notepad++ users globally, including developers and enterprise IT staff who rely on the editor for scripting and configuration tasks. The selective targeting suggests high-value espionage objectives, and the infrastructure abuse model—compromising distribution channels rather than the software itself—represents a growing threat vector for stealthy, large-scale malware delivery.",

These flaws enable remote code execution and local file theft, with attackers able to pivot laterally across development environments after compromising just one extension.\n\nParagraph 2: With over 125 million combined installs, the exposure spans individual developers, startups, and Fortune 500 engineering teams. The compromise of core developer tooling represents a high-impact supply chain risk: a single malicious or compromised extension can lead to exfiltration of source code, credentials, and internal infrastructure data—making this a top-tier threat to software supply chain integrity.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A hacker accessed data from 1.2 million French bank accounts by using stolen credentials of a government official to access a national bank account database. The breach, confirmed by the French Economy Ministry on February 18, involved consultation of personal data including account numbers, names, addresses, and in some cases, tax identification numbers. The attack began in late January and was detected after anomalous access patterns were flagged.\n\nParagraph 2: This incident compromises critical financial data for a significant portion of the French population and reveals systemic weaknesses in credential hygiene and access controls for government-linked systems. The use of stolen official credentials—rather than a technical exploit—highlights the enduring risk of identity-based attacks and the need for stronger MFA enforcement in high-value infrastructure.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Researchers demonstrated that AI assistants like Grok and Microsoft Copilot—when enabled with web browsing and URL-fetching capabilities—can be weaponized to relay command-and-control (C2) traffic for malware. Attackers can abuse these services to fetch instructions or exfiltrate data via seemingly benign HTTP requests to AI platforms, bypassing traditional network security controls that don’t inspect encrypted AI API traffic.\n\nParagraph 2: This technique enables highly evasive, low-and-slow C2 operations that blend with legitimate AI usage, making detection extremely difficult for SOC teams. As enterprise adoption of AI tools grows, this abuse vector represents a new class of infrastructure-based evasion that could undermine existing threat detection frameworks and force a reevaluation of AI service policies in secure environments.",

Attackers can exploit the flaw over the network to take full control of devices, potentially enabling eavesdropping, call hijacking, or lateral movement into internal networks via compromised endpoints.\n\nParagraph 2: With widespread deployment in enterprise and healthcare environments, this vulnerability poses significant risk to voice infrastructure and data confidentiality. The lack of authentication requirement means any attacker on the network (including guest Wi-Fi) can compromise devices, making this a high-priority patch for organizations relying on Grandstream VoIP systems.",

It embeds itself during the build process, injects into the Zygote process, and infects every launched app. Capabilities include ad fraud, credential theft, full remote control, and payload delivery—some variants even spread via OTA updates.\n\nParagraph 2: As firmware-level malware, Keenadu evades standard endpoint security and user detection, threatening millions of consumers and enterprise mobile users. Its distribution through official channels and OTA updates demonstrates the growing sophistication of supply chain compromises in the mobile ecosystem, requiring deeper hardware and OS-level security controls.",
