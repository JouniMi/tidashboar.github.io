      "title": "China‑linked DKnife framework hijacks router traffic for espionage",
      "date": "2026-02-06T18:35:11Z",
      "summary": "Researchers uncovered the DKnife Linux toolkit, a seven‑component adversary‑in‑the‑middle framework used since 2019 to perform deep‑packet inspection, traffic manipulation, and malware delivery on edge routers. The toolkit is deployed by China‑aligned threat actors to compromise routers at the network edge, allowing them to spy on and inject malicious payloads into victim traffic.\n\nThe abuse impacts telecommunications providers, ISPs, government agencies, defense contractors, financial services and manufacturing firms that rely on compromised routing infrastructure. Because the compromise occurs at the network perimeter, detection is difficult, raising the risk of large‑scale data exfiltration and further downstream attacks.",

      "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency warning about CVE‑2026‑24423, an unauthenticated remote‑code‑execution flaw in SmarterTools SmarterMail that allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted HTTP requests. Active exploitation has been observed in the wild, with ransomware operators leveraging the vulnerability to deploy encryptors on compromised mail servers.\n\nEnterprises and service providers that run SmarterMail for email hosting are at immediate risk, as successful exploitation can lead to full server takeover and lateral movement within corporate networks. The rapid adoption of the flaw by ransomware groups elevates the threat to a critical level for any organization relying on SmarterMail for communications.",
