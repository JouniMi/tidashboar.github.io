      "title": "Chinese APT Exploiting Dell Zero-Day Since Mid-2024 Using Ghost NICs",
      "date": "2026-02-18T00:05:58Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A China-linked threat actor has been actively exploiting a maximum-severity hardcoded credential vulnerability in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines as a zero-day since at least mid-2024. Google’s Mandiant incident response team confirmed the campaign—dubbed ‘BrickStorm’—enables long-term backdooring of infected systems. Attackers leverage ‘ghost NICs’ (network interface controllers) to avoid detection by hiding network activity from standard monitoring tools, allowing persistent access and lateral movement within victim environments.\n\nParagraph 2: The full scale of infections remains unknown, but the targeting of enterprise backup and recovery infrastructure poses severe operational and data integrity risks. Compromised systems could enable attackers to disrupt disaster recovery, exfiltrate sensitive backups, or deploy destructive payloads during recovery operations. This represents a high-impact supply chain compromise of critical infrastructure software with potential for widespread disruption across healthcare, finance, and government sectors.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: According to Dragos’ 2026 annual threat report, the Beijing-backed APT group Volt Typhoon continues to compromise cellular gateways and routers to gain persistent access to US electric, oil, and gas companies. The group’s focus remains on positioning for disruption rather than theft—aiming to maintain long-term access to enable future operational disruption. Additionally, three new threat groups began targeting critical infrastructure in 2025, indicating an expanding threat landscape.\n\nParagraph 2: This activity underscores the persistent and strategic threat to US energy and utility sectors from nation-state actors. The compromise of industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) infrastructure raises concerns about potential future disruption of essential services. The report highlights that defenders must prioritize resilience, visibility, and proactive hunting to detect and disrupt such long-term, low-and-slow intrusions.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: The SmartLoader threat actor launched a supply chain attack by cloning a legitimate Oura MCP (Model Context Protocol) server linked to Oura Health. The fake project included fabricated GitHub forks and contributor activity to appear credible, tricking developers into installing a trojanized version. Once executed, the malware deploys the StealC infostealer, which harvests developer credentials, browser passwords, and cryptocurrency wallet data.\n\nParagraph 2: This attack demonstrates a sophisticated evolution in supply chain targeting—abusing trust in AI infrastructure and developer tooling. The use of a real health-tech project (Oura MCP) to mask malicious activity significantly increases success rates and evades traditional reputation-based defenses. Developers and organizations using AI agent frameworks are at heightened risk, especially those integrating third-party MCP servers without rigorous verification.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Kaspersky discovered the Keenadu backdoor embedded in Android device firmware during the manufacturing phase, affecting brands including Alldocube. The malware hooks into Zygote—the parent process for all Android apps—enabling it to compromise every installed application and gain unrestricted system control. It can harvest credentials, intercept communications, and execute remote commands without user awareness.\n\nParagraph 2: Firmware-level compromise is exceptionally difficult to detect and remediate, as standard OS updates or antivirus tools cannot remove it. This attack vector threatens millions of users globally and represents a major escalation in mobile threat sophistication. The integration into signed OTA updates suggests supply chain compromise at the OEM or distributor level, raising serious concerns for device integrity and user privacy.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Google patched a high-severity use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome’s CSS component (CVE-2026-2441), which had been actively exploited in the wild since at least February 2026. Security researcher Shaheen Fazim responsibly disclosed the flaw on February 11, and Google issued an out-of-band emergency update (v145.0.7632.75) to address active exploitation. The vulnerability allows remote code execution within the browser sandbox via malicious webpages.\n\nParagraph 2: As the first actively exploited Chrome zero-day of 2026, this flaw poses immediate risk to all Chrome users globally. Attackers could leverage it for drive-by downloads, credential theft, or lateral movement within enterprise environments. The rapid patch release and emergency update highlight the severity and active threat landscape, underscoring the need for immediate user and admin action to update browsers.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Researchers at Hudson Rock discovered an infostealer malware that successfully exfiltrated victims’ OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) configuration environments—including API keys, gateway tokens, and agent identities. OpenClaw is an open-source framework for building personal AI agents, and its configuration files contain highly sensitive credentials and behavioral profiles. This marks the first known case of infostealers targeting AI agent infrastructure rather than traditional browser credentials.\n\nParagraph 2: The shift to stealing “digital souls” (agent identities and configurations) represents a new frontier in credential theft, enabling attackers to impersonate users in AI-powered workflows, access connected systems, and automate malicious actions at machine speed. As AI agents gain adoption in enterprise and personal workflows, this attack vector significantly expands the blast radius of compromised endpoints and highlights urgent need for agent-specific security controls.",

      "date": "2026-02-16T12:55:00Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Microsoft and other researchers disclosed a new ClickFix variant that abuses the built-in nslookup command to retrieve malware payloads via DNS responses. Instead of traditional mshta or PowerShell, attackers trick users into running a malicious nslookup command that encodes and exfiltrates data or downloads a second-stage payload (e.g., ModeloRAT) via DNS tunneling. This technique evades security controls that block traditional scripting engines.\n\nParagraph 2: The evolution of ClickFix to leverage DNS—a trusted, rarely blocked protocol—demonstrates attackers’ increasing sophistication in bypassing endpoint protections. This method is especially effective against users with limited technical awareness, as nslookup appears legitimate and requires no additional tools. The campaign targets crypto users, Mac users, and general consumers, indicating broad threat potential across consumer and enterprise environments.",

The campaign targets JavaScript and Python developers with fake cryptocurrency job offers, tricking them into installing infected packages that establish remote access and credential theft capabilities. ReversingLabs confirmed the campaign’s persistence and evolving tactics, including package renaming and obfuscation.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain attack demonstrates Lazarus Group’s continued focus on developer tooling to compromise high-value targets and gain initial access to enterprise networks. Compromised packages can lead to data theft, infrastructure compromise, and further lateral movement. Organizations using open-source dependencies must implement strict package vetting, dependency scanning, and developer security awareness training to mitigate such threats.",
