      "summary": "Paragraph 1: CISA added four critical vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, including CVE-2025-15556 in Notepad++, CVE-2024-43468 in Microsoft Configuration Manager, CVE-2025-40536 in SolarWinds Web Help Desk, and CVE-2026-20700 in Apple devices. These flaws are actively exploited in the wild, with Notepad++’s vulnerability allowing download of code without integrity checks, and SolarWinds’ flaw enabling security control bypass.\n\nParagraph 2: The inclusion in the KEV catalog mandates immediate remediation for U.S. federal agencies and signals high risk for enterprise environments. Notepad++’s widespread adoption (millions of users) and SolarWinds’ history as a supply chain attack vector make these particularly concerning, especially given the zero-day nature of some exploits dating back to December 2025.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Google’s Threat Analysis Group (GTIG) confirmed that state-backed actors—including North Korea’s UNC2970 and China’s APT31—are actively using Google’s Gemini AI model for cyber operations. UNC2970 used Gemini to conduct reconnaissance, while APT31 leveraged it to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan attacks against U.S. organizations. Google also detected model extraction attempts targeting proprietary AI systems.\n\nParagraph 2: This marks a significant escalation in AI weaponization, where adversaries use generative AI to automate and refine phishing, social engineering, and targeting. The use of AI for culturally accurate, multi-step phishing undermines traditional detection methods and raises concerns about the misuse of commercial AI tools in nation-state operations.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A critical unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in BeyondTrust Remote Support (CVE-2026-1731), patched in February 2026, was actively exploited within 24 hours of a proof-of-concept (PoC) being published. Threat actors targeted the flaw to gain privileged access to systems, with watchTowr reporting global exploitation attempts across its sensors.\n\nParagraph 2: Given BeyondTrust’s widespread use in enterprise environments for privileged access management, exploitation of this flaw enables attackers to escalate privileges, move laterally, and compromise high-value assets. The speed of exploitation underscores the danger of public PoCs for critical infrastructure software.",

Another campaign involved 287 extensions with 37M installs leaking browsing history to data brokers.\n\nParagraph 2: These supply chain compromises exploit trust in the Chrome Web Store and user familiarity with AI tools.

The campaign, active since May 2025, uses social engineering to trick developers into installing malware-laced packages, including the initial graphalgo package in npm.\n\nParagraph 2: By compromising developer tooling ecosystems, Lazarus gains persistent access to corporate networks and intellectual property. This highlights the growing threat of language-specific package repositories as high-value targets for APTs seeking to infiltrate software supply chains.",

Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered the vulnerability was actively exploited in highly targeted attacks against specific individuals, likely by commercial spyware or nation-state actors.\n\nParagraph 2: The zero-day’s age and the sophistication of the exploitation chain—including combination with CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529—suggests advanced persistent actors with significant resources. This underscores the risk of legacy vulnerabilities remaining unpatched in widely used mobile operating systems.",
