      "title": "Dell RecoverPoint Zero-Day Exploited by China-Linked APT Since Mid-2024",
      "date": "2026-02-18T12:15:46Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A suspected China-linked APT group, identified as UNC6201, exploited a critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2026-22769) in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines starting in mid-2024. The flaw, rated CVSS 10.0, stems from hardcoded credentials enabling unauthenticated lateral movement and persistence. Attackers used this access to deploy malware families including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and GRIMBOLT, while employing stealth techniques like 'ghost NICs' to evade detection.\n\nParagraph 2: This long-running campaign compromises critical data protection infrastructure used by enterprises for disaster recovery and replication, undermining trust in backup systems. Affected organizations may have undetected persistent access, risking data exfiltration and operational disruption. The zero-day’s exploitation over nearly a year highlights severe risks in supply chain and infrastructure software with minimal visibility.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Notepad++ disclosed that attackers compromised its hosting provider’s infrastructure to hijack the software’s update mechanism, redirecting legitimate update traffic to malicious servers. This supply chain attack—attributed to a China-linked APT group—allowed selective malware delivery to targeted users without exploiting code flaws in Notepad++ itself. The maintainer patched the issue in v8.9.2 with a hardened 'double lock' update verification process.\n\nParagraph 2: The attack demonstrates how infrastructure-level compromises can bypass traditional application security, affecting thousands of developers and enterprises relying on Notepad++. It underscores the growing risk of third-party hosting compromises as high-value attack vectors, especially for widely used open-source tools with large user bases.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: OX Security researchers discovered critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-65715, CVE-2025-65716, CVE-2025-65717) in four widely used Visual Studio Code extensions—Live Server, Code Runner, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Microsoft Live Preview—collectively installed over 125 million times. These flaws enable remote code execution and local file theft, allowing attackers to pivot across developer environments and compromise entire organizational networks via a single malicious extension.\n\nParagraph 2: Developers and enterprises using these extensions face severe risk of supply chain compromise, intellectual property theft, and lateral movement. The high installation counts and developer-centric nature of the tools make this a widespread, high-impact vulnerability, especially given VS Code’s role as a primary development environment across Fortune 500 and government agencies.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A hacker accessed data from 1.2 million French bank accounts by using stolen credentials of a government official to query a national bank account database. The breach, confirmed by the French Economy Ministry on February 18, involved access to sensitive information including account numbers, names, addresses, and in some cases, tax IDs. The compromise occurred between late January and mid-February 2026.\n\nParagraph 2: This incident highlights the severe risk posed by credential theft and insider threat vectors in critical financial infrastructure. While no direct financial theft was reported, the exposure of personally identifiable and financial data puts millions at elevated risk for identity theft and fraud, and raises concerns about state-sponsored or sophisticated cybercrime activity targeting national financial systems.",

The breach, reported on February 18, follows a pattern of aggressive data theft and public shaming of companies refusing to pay ransoms.\n\nParagraph 2: CarGurus, a major U.S. online vehicle marketplace, now faces reputational damage, regulatory scrutiny, and potential class-action litigation. The leak includes sensitive business and user data, enabling targeted phishing, identity fraud, and corporate espionage. Shiny Hunters’ growing notoriety and operational tempo signal escalating threats to consumer tech platforms.",

They then sent crypto-themed phishing messages and exfiltrated highly sensitive data—including retirement plan details, financial interests, internal meeting notes, and pipeline data—for over one million customers.\n\nParagraph 2: The depth and financial context of the exposed data make this breach exceptionally dangerous for identity theft, social engineering, and market manipulation. With Shiny Hunters threatening to publish the full dataset after Betterment refused to pay a ransom, the incident exemplifies the growing trend of double-extortion attacks targeting financial services firms with high-value personal data.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Researchers demonstrated that AI assistants like Grok and Microsoft Copilot—when enabled with web browsing and URL-fetching capabilities—can be weaponized to relay command-and-control (C2) traffic for malware. Attackers encode malicious instructions in natural language prompts, leveraging the AI’s legitimate web access to fetch payloads or exfiltrate data while evading traditional network security controls.\n\nParagraph 2: This technique represents a paradigm shift in evasion, enabling malware to blend benign AI queries with covert C2 activity. As enterprise adoption of AI assistants grows, this abuse vector poses serious challenges for detection and response, especially for organizations relying on behavioral analysis or network-based telemetry without AI-aware monitoring.",

The flaw is a stack-based buffer overflow that allows attackers to seize full control of devices without authentication, enabling eavesdropping, call manipulation, or pivot into internal networks.\n\nParagraph 2: With VoIP phones often deployed on trusted internal networks and rarely patched, this vulnerability poses severe risk to enterprises using Grandstream devices for business communications. Attackers could deploy persistent backdoors, intercept sensitive calls, or launch lateral movement—especially dangerous for critical infrastructure, healthcare, and finance sectors.",

These flaws are actively exploited in the wild and require remediation within strict federal deadlines.\n\nParagraph 2: Inclusion in the KEV catalog mandates federal agencies to patch within 30 days, but the widespread use of these products in enterprise environments means private-sector organizations are also at high risk. The TeamT5 flaw is especially notable as it affects a product marketed for anti-ransomware protection—highlighting that even security tools can be compromised.",

Like Triada, it embeds during manufacturing, injects into the Zygote process, and infects all launched apps. Capabilities include ad fraud, credential theft, remote control, and payload delivery—some variants even push via OTA updates.\n\nParagraph 2: The firmware-level persistence and multi-stage loader architecture make Keenadu exceptionally resilient and hard to remove. Its presence across consumer and enterprise-adjacent devices (e.g., budget smartphones used in BYOD environments) poses significant supply chain and long-term compromise risks, especially in regions with high adoption of non-flagship Android devices.",
