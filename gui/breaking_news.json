      "title": "DKnife Linux Toolkit Hijacks Router Traffic for AitM Espionage",
      "date": "2026-02-06T18:35:11Z",
      "summary": "A newly discovered Linux-based toolkit named DKnife has been actively used since 2019 by China-linked threat actors to perform adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks by hijacking traffic at the router and edge-device level. The toolkit comprises seven implants that enable deep packet inspection, traffic manipulation, and malware delivery, primarily targeting telecom providers, ISPs, government, and defense sectors.\n\n\nThe campaign demonstrates a sophisticated, long-running infrastructure-level compromise that bypasses traditional endpoint security. By operating at the network edge, attackers gain persistent visibility into encrypted traffic and can pivot laterally into high-value networks, significantly expanding the attack surface beyond conventional malware delivery methods.",

      "summary": "CISA has issued an urgent advisory about CVE-2026-24423, an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in SmarterMail email servers, which is actively being exploited in ransomware attacks. The flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary code without authentication, enabling rapid deployment of ransomware payloads across unpatched mail infrastructure.\n\n\nWith SmarterMail widely used by mid-sized businesses and government agencies, this vulnerability poses immediate risk to email systems globally. CISA added the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, mandating federal agencies patch within 14 days—highlighting the severity and active exploitation态势.",

      "summary": "A previously undocumented state-aligned threat group, tracked as TGR-STA-1030/UNC6619, has launched a global cyberespionage campaign dubbed 'Shadow Campaigns,' targeting government infrastructure across 155 countries. The group has compromised at least 70 entities in 37 countries since 2025, using custom malware, zero-day exploits, and supply chain techniques to maintain persistence.\n\n\nThe scale and sophistication of the operation—spanning diplomatic missions, defense contractors, and critical infrastructure—indicates a high-impact, long-term espionage effort. This campaign represents one of the most geographically extensive state-sponsored intrusions ever documented, with implications for international security and data sovereignty.",

The breach occurred in October 2025 but went undetected for months before Substack disclosed it on February 5, 2026. Passwords and financial data were not compromised.\n\n\nSubstack serves tens of thousands of writers and over 35 million readers globally, making this a high-profile breach affecting prominent journalists, authors, and influencers.

Students cannot access exam booking, tuition systems, or faculty directories, and the university has resorted to social media for limited communication. The shutdown was ordered as a precaution to contain the attack.\n\n\nThe prolonged outage demonstrates the operational paralysis ransomware can cause in critical public institutions.

The directive aims to reduce technical debt and eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by state-sponsored actors targeting legacy infrastructure.\n\n\nThis policy reflects growing concern over unpatched edge devices as high-value targets for nation-state actors. With over 100,000 such devices likely in federal use, the mandate represents a major shift in federal cybersecurity lifecycle management and sets a precedent for critical infrastructure sectors.",

The attack leverages trust in open-source dependencies to target developers and crypto users.\n\n\nThis incident exemplifies the rising threat of supply chain compromises in developer tooling ecosystems.

Attackers impersonate trusted contacts and exploit Signal’s perceived security to deliver credential-harvesting links or malware.\n\n\nThe use of Signal—a platform trusted for end-to-end encryption—demonstrates evolving attacker tradecraft that leverages platform trust and social engineering to bypass technical defenses.
