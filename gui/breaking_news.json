      "date": "2026-02-06T18:35:11Z",
      "summary": "Researchers uncovered a Linux‑based framework called DKnife that has been used since 2019 to perform adversary‑in‑the‑middle attacks on edge routers. The toolkit performs deep‑packet inspection, traffic manipulation and malware delivery and is attributed to China‑aligned threat actors.\n\nThe abuse compromises telecommunications providers, ISP back‑bones and government networks, allowing attackers to intercept, alter and inject malicious payloads at the network edge. Because the compromise occurs on widely deployed routing hardware, the attack surface spans critical infrastructure and enterprise environments, raising urgent mitigation concerns.",
