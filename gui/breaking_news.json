      "date": "2026-02-26T11:40:33Z",
      "summary": "A critical authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-20127, CVSS 10.0) in Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller and Manager has been actively exploited since at least 2023, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to gain full administrative access. The flaw resides in the peering authentication mechanism and enables attackers to manipulate network configurations, potentially compromising core infrastructure traffic routing and control planes across enterprise and government networks.\n\nCISA added the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance issued a rare joint alert urging immediate patching. Exploitation targets SD-WAN control systems that manage traffic across large-scale networks, making this a high-impact, widespread risk to critical infrastructure and national security systems.",

      "summary": "Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), in collaboration with Mandiant and other industry partners, disrupted UNC2814, a suspected China-nexus APT that breached at least 53 organizations across 42 countries since at least 2017. The group primarily targeted telecommunications providers and government agencies in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, using Google Sheets and SaaS APIs as covert command-and-control infrastructure to disguise malicious traffic as benign business activity.\n\nThe campaign demonstrates a sophisticated shift toward cloud-native C2 infrastructure, enabling stealthy long-term access and data exfiltration. Disruption involved takedowns of malicious infrastructure and coordination with global security vendors, highlighting the growing reliance on cloud platforms for espionage operations and the need for cross-industry threat intelligence sharing.",

Hackers exfiltrated personal data including names, email addresses, phone numbers, and order histories. The breach underscores the escalating risk posed by third-party vendors with inadequate security postures.\n\nThe incident highlights the supply chain attack vector as a dominant threat, with attackers increasingly targeting intermediaries to gain access to high-value targets. With ManoMano operating across Europe, the breach has broad geographic and regulatory implications, including under GDPR, and may trigger further disclosures as impacted customers and authorities respond.",

      "summary": "North Korea’s Lazarus Group has begun deploying Medusa ransomware—traditionally operated by the Spearwing group—in attacks targeting a U.S. healthcare organization and an unnamed entity in the Middle East. This marks a strategic shift for Lazarus toward profit-driven ransomware operations alongside its traditional espionage and financial theft activities, signaling increased convergence between nation-state and cybercrime tactics.\n\nMedusa, a ransomware-as-a-service launched in 2023, enables data theft and encryption, aligning with Lazarus’s evolving dual-mission model. The adoption of third-party ransomware tools reflects a trend toward modular, outsourced attack capabilities, increasing the speed and scalability of operations while reducing development overhead for sophisticated threat actors.",

      "summary": "Oasis Security disclosed a critical flaw chain (CVE-2026-25253) in the OpenClaw AI agent framework that allows malicious websites to bypass localhost trust assumptions and gain full control of locally running agents. Modern browsers permit external JavaScript to open WebSocket connections to local services, enabling attackers to brute-force credentials, pair unauthorized devices, and execute arbitrary commands—effectively turning the victim’s machine into a remote-controlled node.\n\nThis vulnerability exemplifies the dangerous blurring of trust boundaries between web and local environments, particularly as AI agents gain broader system access. With OpenClaw designed for developer productivity, exploitation could lead to widespread compromise of development machines, code repositories, and cloud credentials, making this a high-risk issue for enterprise security.",

      "summary": "Qrator Research Lab identified Aeternum C2, a new botnet loader that stores encrypted command-and-control instructions on the Polygon blockchain, making takedown efforts extremely difficult. Unlike traditional domain- or server-based C2, Aeternum reads instructions from on-chain smart contracts, enabling resilient, decentralized control that evades domain takedowns, DNS sinkholing, and IP blacklisting.\n\nThis represents a significant evolution in botnet architecture, leveraging blockchain’s immutability and decentralization to enhance resilience. The use of public blockchains for malicious C2 is a growing concern, as it allows attackers to scale operations globally while resisting infrastructure disruption—posing new challenges for threat hunters and incident responders.",

      "summary": "CISA released new details on RESURGE, a malicious implant used in zero-day attacks exploiting CVE-2025-0282 in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances. The vulnerability enables remote code execution, allowing attackers to deploy persistent backdoors and maintain long-term access to compromised networks. CISA added the flaw to its KEV catalog and warned that RESURGE can remain dormant for extended periods before activating.\n\nGiven the widespread use of Ivanti devices in government and enterprise environments, this vulnerability poses a severe risk. The dormant nature of RESURGE increases dwell time and complicates detection, requiring urgent patching and memory scanning for indicators of compromise across affected networks.",

      "summary": "Google revealed that previously harmless Cloud API keys—commonly embedded in client-side code for services like Maps—can now authenticate to the Gemini AI API, exposing sensitive data and enabling unauthorized usage. Researchers found over 2,800 live keys in public repositories belonging to major financial, security, and recruiting firms—including Google itself—demonstrating a systemic misconfiguration of trust boundaries.\n\nThis flaw stems from Google’s historical guidance permitting public API keys for non-sensitive services, which created a skeleton key problem when Gemini’s API accepted the same identifiers. The incident highlights the risks of reusing credentials across services and the need for strict separation of authentication scopes, especially as AI platforms become integrated into enterprise workflows.",
