      "date": "2026-02-10T22:31:47Z",
      "summary": "Microsoft’s February 2026 Patch Tuesday addressed six actively exploited zero-day vulnerabilities across Windows, Office, and Edge, including CVE-2026-21510—a Shell and SmartScreen bypass enabling attackers to evade security warnings and execute arbitrary code via malicious shortcuts or links, and CVE-2026-21513, an Internet Explorer security control bypass leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe six flaws affect all supported Windows versions and Office suites, putting millions of enterprise and consumer systems at immediate risk. Three of the zero-days were publicly known, indicating active exploitation by threat actors. Organizations that delayed patching are highly vulnerable to initial access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement attacks, especially given the high CVSS scores (up to 8.8) and the criticality of the affected components.",

      "date": "2026-02-10T10:09:46Z",
      "summary": "China-linked APT UNC3886 conducted a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign against Singapore’s four major telecommunications providers—Singtel, StarHub, M1, and SIMBA Telecom—using zero-day exploits, rootkits, and passive backdoors to avoid detection. The operation, part of Singapore’s Operation CYBER GUARDIAN, targeted critical telecom infrastructure without disrupting services or accessing customer data.\n\nThe attack demonstrates a high level of persistence and technical sophistication, with UNC3886 leveraging previously unknown vulnerabilities and tampering with logs to maintain long-term access. As telcos are foundational to national infrastructure, this breach poses significant strategic risks, including potential future disruption, surveillance, and supply chain compromise. It also underscores the growing threat of state-sponsored actors targeting critical infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region.",

      "summary": "A newly discovered commercial mobile spyware platform named ZeroDayRAT is being sold on Telegram and grants attackers full remote control over compromised Android and iOS devices—including live camera access, keylogging, banking app theft, and crypto wallet extraction. The toolkit, analyzed by iVerify, rivals nation-state capabilities and requires no technical expertise to deploy.\n\nWith a built-in control panel, sales channels, and automated updates, ZeroDayRAT represents a dangerous democratization of advanced surveillance tools. Its distribution via smishing, phishing, and fake apps puts high-value individuals (executives, journalists, activists) at severe risk. The availability of such a mature, off-the-shelf solution significantly lowers the barrier to entry for cybercriminals and nation-state proxies, escalating mobile threat landscapes globally.",

      "summary": "A fake 7-Zip website (7zip[.]com) is distributing a trojanized installer that covertly converts infected machines into residential proxy nodes, masking attacker traffic and enabling anonymized malicious operations. Microsoft Defender has flagged the malware as Trojan:Win32/Malgent!MSR, and victims often remain unaware for weeks due to the stealthy nature of the payload.\n\nThis supply chain compromise exploits user trust in widely used utilities and mimics official branding with high fidelity. The abuse of home PCs as proxy infrastructure enables attackers to bypass corporate firewalls, conduct credential stuffing, and evade geoblocking—posing serious risks to both individuals and organizations. It also highlights the growing trend of infrastructure abuse via compromised software distribution channels.",

These campaigns use social engineering to trick victims into executing malicious payloads disguised as legitimate software updates or video files.\n\nThe use of AI-generated content significantly increases the credibility of phishing attempts, making detection by both users and traditional security tools more difficult. By focusing on crypto targets, the group aims to steal private keys, exchange credentials, and siphon digital assets—posing a direct financial threat to individuals and firms in the rapidly growing Web3 ecosystem.",

The National Cyber Security Center was alerted on January 29, and the incidents were reported to parliament.\n\nThe exploitation of a critical, unpatched EPMM instance demonstrates how third-party software flaws can rapidly cascade into high-profile breaches across public institutions. With EPMM managing mobile devices and security policies, attackers gained insight into personnel structures and potentially laid groundwork for further insider-targeted operations. This incident reinforces the urgency of rapid patching for privileged management tools.",

Huntress confirmed active exploitation as of February 7, 2026, targeting unpatched instances and enabling lateral movement across networks.\n\nThe abuse of a widely deployed IT service management tool exemplifies the growing trend of attackers weaponizing legitimate tools (Living-off-the-Land) to evade detection. CVE-2025-40551 and CVE-2025-26399—now in CISA’s KEV catalog—remain widely unpatched, leaving thousands of organizations exposed.

      "summary": "The emerging Reynolds ransomware family includes a built-in Bring-Your-Own-Vulnerable-Driver (BYOVD) component that disables Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools by exploiting signed but vulnerable drivers to escalate privileges and neutralize security software.\n\nThis technique significantly raises the bar for detection and mitigation, as it leverages legitimate driver signatures to bypass kernel-mode protections. By disabling EDR before encryption, Reynolds increases the likelihood of successful ransomware deployment and reduces incident response time. The use of BYOVD reflects a broader shift toward advanced defense evasion tactics by ransomware operators, particularly targeting organizations with mature security postures.",

While no mobile devices were compromised, the breach targeted backend infrastructure managing EU institutional communications.\n\nThe incident highlights vulnerabilities in MDM systems—a high-value target for espionage and credential harvesting. Given the Commission’s role in EU governance, attackers may seek intelligence on policy decisions, diplomatic communications, or internal operations. The swift containment (within nine hours) demonstrates improved incident response, but the breach underscores persistent risks in third-party and cloud-managed infrastructure.",

These tools enable persistent access, keylogging, screen capture, and data exfiltration via custom C2 infrastructure.\n\nThe coordinated use of multiple RAT families suggests a well-resourced, long-term operation focused on strategic intelligence gathering. The targeting of defense institutions indicates intent to compromise national security operations, potentially influencing regional stability. This campaign aligns with increasing cross-border cyber tensions in South Asia and demonstrates the evolving sophistication of non-state-aligned threat actors.",
