      "title": "SSHStalker Botnet Infects 7,000+ Linux Systems Using 2009-Era Exploits",
      "date": "2026-02-11T09:56:00Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A newly discovered Linux botnet named SSHStalker has compromised approximately 7,000 systems by exploiting legacy vulnerabilities—including CVE-2009-2698, CVE-2009-1895, and CVE-2010-0437—via mass SSH scanning and credential stuffing. The botnet uses Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for command-and-control (C2), a rare and stealthy choice that evades modern network detection systems. Researchers from Flare identified the campaign through SSH honeypots, noting its use of rootkit artifacts and log tampering to maintain persistence without active malicious operations.\n\nParagraph 2: While currently dormant, SSHStalker possesses capabilities to launch DDoS attacks and conduct cryptomining, indicating high latent threat potential. Its reliance on outdated exploits suggests targeting of poorly maintained or legacy infrastructure, particularly in cloud environments like Oracle Cloud. This campaign demonstrates a resurgence of old-school tactics combined with modern automation, posing a significant risk to organizations with unpatched legacy systems.",

      "date": "2026-02-10T22:31:47Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Microsoft’s February 2026 Patch Tuesday addressed 58 vulnerabilities, including six actively exploited zero-days—five Critical and two Moderate. Notably, CVE-2026-21510 enables Shell prompt bypass via single-click malicious links, while CVE-2026-21513 exploits MSHTML to execute arbitrary code, and CVE-2026-21533 allows privilege escalation in Remote Desktop Services. Three of the six flaws were publicly known before patching, indicating active exploitation by threat actors.\n\nParagraph 2: These vulnerabilities affect all supported Windows versions and Microsoft Office, putting millions of enterprise and consumer endpoints at immediate risk. CISA added five of the six flaws to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, underscoring urgency for patching. Given the high severity and active exploitation, organizations face elevated risk of ransomware, credential theft, and lateral movement—making this one of the most critical Patch Tuesdays in recent memory.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: The North Korea-linked APT group UNC1069 has launched targeted campaigns against cryptocurrency organizations using AI-generated video content and a ClickFix infection vector to deliver malware on Windows and macOS systems. The attack chain begins with compromised Telegram accounts and fake Zoom meetings, culminating in credential theft and financial theft. Researchers observed the use of AI-generated social engineering content to increase deception effectiveness.\n\nParagraph 2: This campaign highlights the growing adoption of AI by nation-state threat actors to enhance phishing realism and bypass user skepticism. By focusing on the crypto sector—a high-value target for financial gain—UNC1069 demonstrates continued alignment with DPRK’s strategic cyber objectives. Organizations in fintech and digital asset management must prioritize user awareness training and endpoint detection for novel delivery vectors like ClickFix.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: China-linked APT UNC3886 conducted a sophisticated cyber espionage campaign targeting all four major Singaporean telecom operators—M1, SIMBA Telecom, Singtel, and StarHub—using zero-day exploits and rootkits. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) confirmed the intrusion as part of Operation CYBER GUARDIAN, which involved over 100 personnel and spanned months. UNC3886 prioritized stealth, deploying passive backdoors and tampering with forensic logs to avoid detection.\n\nParagraph 2: Though no customer data or network operations were disrupted, the compromise of critical telecom infrastructure represents a severe threat to national security and signals intent to establish long-term access for future operations. The group previously exploited the Fortinet zero-day CVE-2022-41328 in 2023, underscoring its capability to leverage zero-days against network devices and virtualization platforms. This incident reinforces the need for zero-trust architectures in critical infrastructure sectors.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Researchers discovered that Microsoft’s recent Markdown support in Notepad can be exploited to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by crafting malicious files that trigger arbitrary code when rendered. The flaw leverages the integration between Markdown and embedded HTML/JavaScript elements, bypassing traditional sandboxing assumptions. This vulnerability is especially concerning given Notepad’s ubiquity and trust level among users and administrators.\n\nParagraph 2: The exploit enables attackers to bypass security warnings and execute payloads via social engineering—such as embedding malicious links in phishing emails or documents—without requiring elevated privileges. While Microsoft has not yet issued a patch, the ease of exploitation and the tool’s default presence on Windows systems make this a high-risk vector for initial access in supply chain and targeted attacks.",

Developed by a third-party vendor, it offers live camera access, keylogging, banking and crypto theft, and remote control—all via a user-friendly admin panel. The tool requires no technical expertise and infects devices through smishing, phishing, fake apps, or malicious links.\n\nParagraph 2: ZeroDayRAT rivals nation-state spyware in capability and is accessible to low-sophistication threat actors, dramatically lowering the barrier to high-impact mobile espionage. Its availability threatens individuals, enterprises, and government personnel alike. With no known patch available, organizations must prioritize mobile device policy enforcement, app vetting, and user education to mitigate exposure.",

The National Cyber Security Center was alerted on January 29, 2026, and the incidents were reported to parliament. The vulnerabilities enabled remote credential theft and exposure of employee contact data.\n\nParagraph 2: This incident underscores the rapid weaponization of vendor-disclosed flaws—especially in privileged management tools like EPMM, which controls mobile device security policies across enterprises. The compromise of two key government oversight bodies highlights systemic risks in third-party software supply chains and the need for immediate patching and network segmentation.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Fortinet released emergency patches for a critical SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2026-21643) in FortiClientEMS with a CVSS score of 9.1. The flaw allows unauthenticated remote code execution via crafted HTTP requests, enabling attackers to gain initial access, deploy malware, and pivot laterally. The vulnerability was internally discovered and poses severe risk to organizations with internet-facing FortiClientEMS instances.\n\nParagraph 2: As FortiClientEMS is widely used for endpoint management and policy enforcement, successful exploitation could compromise large swaths of an organization’s device fleet. With multiple reports of active exploitation in the wild, this is a top-priority patch for security teams—especially those managing hybrid or remote work environments reliant on Fortinet’s endpoint infrastructure.",

Huntress confirmed active exploitation as of February 7, 2026, with attackers using Cloudflare tunnels and domain discovery commands to map internal networks post-exploitation.\n\nParagraph 2: This campaign exemplifies the “living off the land” tactic—leveraging trusted tools to evade detection—while targeting IT service desks, which often have privileged access across enterprise environments. CISA added CVE-2025-40551 to its KEV catalog, and Microsoft has observed multi-stage intrusions using WHD as an initial access vector.

CERT-EU identified intrusion traces, and while no mobile devices were compromised, attackers may have accessed staff names and phone numbers. The Commission contained and cleaned the system within nine hours and continues to strengthen defenses.\n\nParagraph 2: Though the breach appears limited in scope, the compromise of an MDM platform—used to manage EU officials’ devices—raises concerns about potential lateral movement and future intelligence gathering. As the EU’s executive body, this incident poses reputational and operational risks, especially amid increasing geopolitical cyber tensions. The breach underscores the need for enhanced monitoring of privileged infrastructure and zero-trust access controls.",
