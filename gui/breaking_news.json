      "title": "APT37 and ScarCruft Deploy New Malware to Breach Air-Gapped Networks",
      "date": "2026-02-27T19:21:25Z",
      "summary": "North Korean threat actors APT37 and ScarCruft are actively deploying sophisticated new malware tools designed to bridge internet-connected systems with air-gapped networks. The campaigns utilize removable media for data exfiltration and leverage Zoho WorkDrive as a command-and-control infrastructure to maintain persistence and evade detection.\n\nThis development represents a significant escalation in state-sponsored espionage capabilities, as it directly targets high-value, isolated environments often used by critical infrastructure and defense sectors. The ability to bypass air-gaps using legitimate cloud services and physical media vectors poses a severe risk to national security and industrial control systems.",

      "summary": "Juniper Networks has released an out-of-band emergency patch for CVE-2026-21902, a critical remote code execution vulnerability affecting PTX Series routers running Junos OS Evolved. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to execute code with root privileges by exploiting incorrect permissions in the On-Box Anomaly Detection framework.\n\nGiven that PTX routers often sit at the core of enterprise and service provider networks, successful exploitation could lead to total network takeover, traffic interception, and pivoting to adjacent systems. The high CVSS score and the strategic position of these devices make immediate patching essential for global network operators.",

      "summary": "Researchers discovered that a silent change in Google Cloud Platform API key behavior has exposed thousands of organizations to data theft. Keys previously treated as non-secret billing identifiers are now being used to authenticate to sensitive Gemini AI endpoints, allowing attackers to access private data and run up bills.\n\nThe scan identified nearly 3,000 live keys embedded in public code belonging to major financial institutions, security firms, and Google itself. This widespread misconfiguration highlights a critical supply chain risk where legacy developer practices are now being weaponized against high-value AI infrastructure.",

      "summary": "A new botnet named Aeternum has been identified using Polygon blockchain smart contracts to host its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. By decentralizing its instructions on a public ledger, the malware avoids traditional server-based takedowns and becomes significantly more resilient against disruption.\n\nThis innovative abuse of blockchain technology makes the botnet effectively permanent and harder to detect, as it leverages the same infrastructure used by legitimate decentralized applications. The technique represents a major evolution in botnet persistence, challenging traditional cybersecurity takedown strategies.",

      "summary": "A critical flaw dubbed 'ClawJacked' in the OpenClaw AI agent platform allows malicious websites to connect to locally running AI agents via WebSocket and seize full control. The vulnerability exploits the assumption that localhost connections are trusted, enabling attackers to bypass rate limits and execute unauthorized commands.\n\nThis issue compromises the security of local AI deployments, allowing remote attackers to hijack agents through a simple browser visit. As AI agents become more integrated into local workflows, this vector poses a significant risk to data privacy and system integrity for developers and enterprises using OpenClaw.",
