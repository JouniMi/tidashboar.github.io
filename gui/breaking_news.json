      "title": "China-linked APT Exploiting Dell RecoverPoint Zero-Day Since Mid-2024",
      "date": "2026-02-18T12:15:46Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A suspected China-linked APT group, identified as UNC6201, has been actively exploiting a critical hardcoded-credential vulnerability (CVE-2026-22769, CVSS 10.0) in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines since at least mid-2024. The flaw enables attackers to bypass authentication, move laterally across networks, and deploy advanced malware such as SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and GRIMBOLT. According to Mandiant and Google GTIG, the group uses ‘ghost NICs’ to avoid detection and maintain persistent access.\n\nParagraph 2: This long-running campaign compromises critical infrastructure and enterprise data protection systems, with Dell RecoverPoint widely used for disaster recovery and replication in large organizations. The zero-day exploitation demonstrates the growing threat of supply chain and infrastructure-level attacks targeting high-value backup systems, potentially enabling data destruction or ransomware deployment across entire enterprise environments.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Notepad++ patched a critical vulnerability that enabled a China-linked APT group to hijack its update infrastructure by compromising the hosting provider. Attackers redirected update traffic to malicious servers, selectively delivering malware to targeted users without modifying the Notepad++ source code. The attack leveraged infrastructure-level compromise rather than a code-level flaw, making it exceptionally difficult to detect.\n\nParagraph 2: With over 100 million downloads, Notepad++ is a high-impact target for supply chain attacks affecting developers and enterprises globally. The incident underscores the growing risk of third-party infrastructure compromise and highlights how even open-source tools can become vectors for sophisticated, targeted malware deployment.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A hacker accessed data from 1.2 million French bank accounts by using stolen credentials of a government official to access a national bank account database. The breach, confirmed by the French Economy Ministry, exposed sensitive data including bank account numbers, names, addresses, and in some cases, tax identification numbers. The compromise occurred between late January and mid-February 2026.\n\nParagraph 2: This incident demonstrates the severe risk posed by credential theft and insider access abuse in critical financial infrastructure. The large-scale exposure of financial data via a single compromised government credential highlights systemic weaknesses in identity governance and the need for stricter access controls and MFA enforcement across public-private data interfaces.",

Collectively installed over 125 million times, these flaws enable attackers to perform lateral movement and compromise entire development environments with minimal effort.\n\nParagraph 2: Developers represent high-value targets due to access to source code, internal repositories, and production systems. Compromising IDE extensions creates a powerful attack vector for supply chain compromise, intellectual property theft, and deployment of backdoors across enterprise code pipelines. This incident highlights the urgent need for better extension vetting and runtime isolation in development tools.",

The malware infects the Zygote process to compromise every app launched on the device, enabling ad fraud, credential theft, and full remote control. Some variants have been distributed through Google Play and third-party app stores, evading detection due to digital signing.\n\nParagraph 2: With preinstallation at the firmware level, Keenadu bypasses traditional security controls and persists across factory resets. Its deployment across multiple device brands (e.g., Alldocube) indicates a large-scale supply chain compromise. This represents a major escalation in mobile malware sophistication and poses serious risks to consumer privacy, enterprise BYOD policies, and mobile threat defense strategies.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Researchers demonstrated that AI assistants like Microsoft Copilot and xAI Grok—when enabled with web browsing and URL-fetching capabilities—can be repurposed as covert command-and-control (C2) channels. Malware can instruct the AI to fetch payloads or exfiltrate data via legitimate HTTPS requests to AI services, blending seamlessly with normal enterprise traffic and evading traditional network security tools.\n\nParagraph 2: This technique dramatically increases the stealth and resilience of malware operations, especially in environments with strict egress filtering. As AI tools become integrated into enterprise workflows, attackers can abuse their trusted status and broad permissions to maintain persistent, undetected access—marking a new phase in AI-powered cyberattacks.",

Attackers built fake GitHub repositories with forged forks and contributors to mimic legitimacy, tricking developers into downloading a trojanized version. Once installed, the malware steals browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and developer tokens.\n\nParagraph 2: This campaign exploits the growing adoption of AI agent frameworks like MCP, targeting developers and early adopters of AI tools. It illustrates how threat actors are weaponizing trust in open-source AI infrastructure, turning legitimate developer ecosystems into attack vectors for credential harvesting and lateral movement.",
