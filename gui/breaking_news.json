      "title": "Notepad++ supply‑chain attack attributed to China‑linked Lotus Blossom APT",
      "date": "2026-02-03T09:35:23Z",
      "summary": "Rapid7 researchers discovered that the update infrastructure for the popular Notepad++ editor was compromised by a state‑sponsored group dubbed Lotus Blossom. Attackers hijacked the hosting provider, intercepted legitimate update requests and served malicious payloads that installed a backdoor named Chrysalis on victim machines.\n\nThe breach affects millions of developers worldwide and indirectly impacts Microsoft Windows users who receive the compromised updates. Because the attack leveraged the software‑distribution supply chain rather than a code flaw, it demonstrates a high‑impact vector for nation‑state actors and forces vendors to reassess trust in third‑party hosting services.",

      "date": "2026-02-03T09:12:00Z",
      "summary": "The Russian‑linked APT28 group launched Operation Neusploit, exploiting a freshly disclosed Microsoft Office vulnerability (CVE‑2026‑21509) to deliver malicious RTF files that execute the MiniDoor and PixyNetLoader loaders. The campaign targeted users in Ukraine, Slovakia and Romania, using weaponised documents to gain initial footholds and exfiltrate email data.\n\nMicrosoft’s flagship productivity suite is used by enterprises worldwide, making the exploit a potent espionage tool. The rapid weaponisation of a zero‑day underscores the urgent need for accelerated patching and heightened email‑gateway defenses across Fortune‑500 organizations.",

      "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added CVE‑2025‑22225, a critical arbitrary‑write flaw in VMware ESXi, to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog after confirming ransomware operators are using it to escape VM sandboxes and deploy ransomware payloads. The vulnerability allows attackers with VM‑level privileges to write to the hypervisor kernel and gain host‑level code execution.\n\nVMware ESXi underpins the virtual infrastructure of countless enterprises, cloud providers and critical‑infrastructure operators. Active exploitation signals a severe risk to data‑center security and forces organisations to apply Broadcom’s March‑2025 patch or migrate workloads immediately.",

      "summary": "CISA announced that the critical remote‑code‑execution flaw in SolarWinds Web Help Desk (CVE‑2025‑40551) has been observed in the wild and was added to the agency’s KEV catalog. The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of untrusted data, enabling unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on affected servers.\n\nSolarWinds products are widely deployed across U.S. federal agencies and private‑sector enterprises, making the active exploitation a significant supply‑chain threat. Agencies have been ordered to patch within three days, and organisations using the Web Help Desk component must prioritize remediation to prevent full system compromise.",

      "summary": "Researchers uncovered a campaign in which ransomware gangs lease virtual machines from ISPsystem, a legitimate infrastructure‑management provider, to host and distribute malicious payloads. By abusing the provider’s VM provisioning APIs, attackers achieve high availability and evade detection while serving ransomware binaries to victims.\n\nThe abuse of a commercial VM service represents a novel supply‑chain vector that can affect any organisation that downloads files from compromised URLs. ISPsystem customers and downstream enterprises must audit inbound traffic from these VMs and consider network‑level blocking to mitigate the threat.",

      "summary": "Security researchers observed threat actors leveraging CVE‑2025‑11953, a command‑injection flaw in the React Native CLI’s Metro development server, to execute arbitrary commands and drop Rust‑based malware on developer machines before the vulnerability was publicly disclosed. The flaw allows unauthenticated network attackers to send crafted POST requests that run shell commands on the host.\n\nReact Native is used by thousands of mobile‑app developers, meaning the exploit can compromise development environments and propagate malicious code into production apps. The active exploitation underscores the need for immediate mitigation, such as binding the Metro server to localhost and applying vendor patches.",

The group employs custom Linux kernel rootkits and credential‑stealing toolkits to maintain long‑term persistence and exfiltrate sensitive data.\n\nThe campaign targets high‑value sectors such as energy, transportation and public administration, raising concerns for national security. While the exact nation‑state sponsor remains unconfirmed, the breadth of the intrusion highlights the growing sophistication of supply‑chain and supply‑chain‑adjacent attacks on critical assets.",
