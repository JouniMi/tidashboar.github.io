      "title": "Dell RecoverPoint Zero-Day Exploited by China-Linked APT Since Mid-2024",
      "date": "2026-02-18T12:15:46Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A suspected China-linked APT group (UNC6201) has been actively exploiting a maximum-severity hardcoded-credential vulnerability (CVE-2026-22769, CVSS 10.0) in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines as a zero-day since at least mid-2024. Mandiant and Google GTIG confirmed the flaw enables lateral movement, persistence, and deployment of malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and GRIMBOLT. The attack leverages hard-coded credentials embedded in the appliance firmware to gain administrative access without authentication.\n\nParagraph 2: This long-running campaign compromises critical data protection infrastructure used by enterprises and government agencies to secure virtual machine backups. The stealthy nature—using ghost NICs to avoid detection—and the use of advanced malware toolsets pose severe risks to data integrity and availability. Organizations relying on Dell RecoverPoint for disaster recovery and compliance may face undetected data exfiltration or destruction, undermining foundational resilience strategies.",

      "date": "2026-02-18T19:28:02Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Notepad++ patched a critical vulnerability (CVE-2026-25926) after a China-linked APT group compromised the software’s hosting provider infrastructure to redirect update traffic to malicious servers. The attack did not exploit code flaws in Notepad++ itself but instead intercepted legitimate update requests before delivery, selectively pushing malware to targeted users. The maintainer confirmed the compromise occurred at the hosting provider level, enabling supply chain injection of malicious payloads.\n\nParagraph 2: With over 100 million installations globally, Notepad++ is widely used by developers, sysadmins, and enterprise users—making it a high-impact supply chain target. The selective nature of the attack suggests highly targeted espionage operations, potentially compromising sensitive development environments and internal toolchains. This incident underscores the growing risk of infrastructure-level compromises in open-source and widely distributed software ecosystems.",

      "date": "2026-02-18T21:25:19Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A hacker accessed data from 1.2 million French bank accounts by using stolen credentials of a government official to access a national bank account database. The breach, confirmed by the French Economy Ministry on February 18, involved consultation of personal data including account numbers, names, addresses, and in some cases, tax identification numbers. The attacker exploited access starting in late January and maintained undetected access for weeks.\n\nParagraph 2: This incident highlights the severe risk posed by credential theft and insider threat vectors in critical financial infrastructure. The compromise of a government-level access point to aggregate banking data represents a high-value target for espionage or financial fraud. Affected individuals face heightened identity theft and fraud risks, and the breach undermines confidence in France’s centralized financial data governance framework.",

      "date": "2026-02-18T15:14:33Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Four widely used Visual Studio Code extensions—including Live Server, Code Runner, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Microsoft Live Preview—contain critical security flaws (CVE-2025-65715, CVE-2025-65716, CVE-2025-65717) that could allow remote code execution and local file theft. Collectively installed over 125 million times, these extensions are used by millions of developers globally. OX Security researchers demonstrated how exploitation enables lateral movement across entire organizational networks via compromised developer workstations.\n\nParagraph 2: Developers are high-value targets due to their privileged access to source code, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure. Compromising a single extension can lead to supply chain attacks, intellectual property theft, or deployment of backdoors into production systems. The widespread adoption of VS Code makes this a systemic risk to software development ecosystems across Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and critical infrastructure providers.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Kaspersky discovered Keenadu, a sophisticated Android backdoor embedded in device firmware during manufacturing and distributed via signed OTA updates. The malware hooks into Zygote—the parent process for all Android apps—to infect every launched application, enabling ad fraud, credential theft, and full remote control. It has been found on devices from multiple brands, including Alldocube, and operates similarly to the Triada malware but with enhanced evasion and persistence capabilities.\n\nParagraph 2: Firmware-level compromise is among the most difficult threats to detect and remediate, especially when distributed through official update channels. With thousands of devices infected, Keenadu poses a systemic risk to mobile security across consumer and enterprise ecosystems. Attackers can harvest banking credentials, intercept 2FA codes, and deploy additional payloads—making this a critical threat to financial and personal data security.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Google patched CVE-2026-2441, a high-severity (CVSS 8.8) use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome’s CSS engine, after it was actively exploited in the wild as the first Chrome zero-day of 2026. Security researcher Shaheen Fazim disclosed the flaw on February 11; attackers leveraged it to execute arbitrary code inside the Chrome sandbox via malicious webpages. Emergency updates were released for Chrome 145 across Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nParagraph 2: Active exploitation of browser zero-days poses immediate risk to all users and organizations, as drive-by downloads can compromise systems without user interaction. Given Chrome’s market dominance, this vulnerability could enable large-scale credential theft, malware deployment, or lateral movement via compromised endpoints. The patch underscores the urgency of automated patching for high-risk browsers used across enterprise and public sectors.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: The SmartLoader threat group cloned a legitimate Oura MCP (Model Context Protocol) server—used to connect AI assistants to Oura Ring health data—to distribute the StealC infostealer. Researchers from Straiker’s STAR Labs confirmed attackers built fake GitHub repositories with forged contributors and forks to mimic legitimacy. Once installed, the trojanized server deployed StealC, which steals browser passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and developer credentials.\n\nParagraph 2: This attack exemplifies the emerging trend of AI supply chain abuse, where threat actors exploit trust in legitimate AI development tools to compromise developers and data scientists. As AI agent frameworks like OpenClaw and MCP gain adoption, attackers are targeting the infrastructure that powers next-generation AI workflows—posing significant risk to organizations deploying AI-powered automation and personal assistants.",

      "date": "2026-02-16T12:24:39Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Microsoft revealed a new ClickFix variant that tricks users into running malicious nslookup commands to retrieve PowerShell payloads via DNS responses. Instead of traditional command-and-control servers, attackers encode malware in DNS TXT records and parse the `Name:` field to execute the next-stage payload. This technique evades network security controls that block direct HTTP/HTTPS traffic while leveraging a legitimate system tool for covert delivery.\n\nParagraph 2: ClickFix attacks rely on social engineering (e.g., fake CAPTCHA prompts) to coerce victims into running commands themselves—making them resilient to traditional endpoint protections. The DNS abuse method significantly expands the attack surface, enabling delivery of RATs like ModeloRAT to Windows and macOS systems. As ClickFix evolves, it demonstrates how legacy tools can be repurposed for modern, stealthy malware distribution.",
