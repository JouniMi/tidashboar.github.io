      "title": "Lazarus Group Deploys Medusa Ransomware in Healthcare and Middle East Attacks",
      "date": "2026-02-24T11:52:00Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: North Korea–backed Lazarus Group (aka Diamond Sleet, Pompilus) has been observed actively using the Medusa ransomware in attacks targeting a healthcare entity in the U.S. and an unnamed organization in the Middle East. Broadcom’s threat intelligence division confirmed the campaign, noting that while the U.S. healthcare attack was unsuccessful, the Middle East operation succeeded in deploying ransomware and initiating data exfiltration. The group leveraged traditional phishing and credential harvesting tactics to gain initial access before deploying Medusa across the environment.\n\nParagraph 2: This activity signals a strategic escalation by Lazarus Group into critical infrastructure sectors, particularly healthcare, where operational disruption can have life-threatening consequences. The use of Medusa—a relatively new ransomware variant—adds operational novelty and complicates detection and attribution. Healthcare organizations globally must prioritize endpoint monitoring, credential hygiene, and third-party risk management to mitigate similar supply chain–linked ransomware intrusions.",

      "date": "2026-02-24T09:10:39Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Russia-linked APT28 (aka Fancy Bear, Sofacy) executed Operation MacroMaze, a targeted campaign against European entities from September 2025 to January 2026. The attack chain began with spear-phishing emails delivering malicious Word documents containing INCLUDEPICTURE fields pointing to webhook[.]site URLs hosting JPGs. These triggered macro execution and deployed a Cobalt Strike beacon, with data exfiltration routed through legitimate Microsoft 365 webhooks to evade network detection. The campaign avoided traditional C2 infrastructure, relying instead on abuse of cloud-based services for stealth.\n\nParagraph 2: This operation demonstrates APT28’s continued sophistication in infrastructure abuse—leveraging widely used cloud services to bypass security controls and extend persistence. Organizations relying on Microsoft 365 must implement strict webhook governance, disable macros by default, and monitor for anomalous webhook usage patterns. The targeting of European government and defense-linked entities underscores the geopolitical relevance of the campaign and the need for proactive threat hunting.",

      "date": "2026-02-23T11:41:47Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A Russian-speaking financially motivated threat actor used commercial generative AI tools to compromise over 600 FortiGate firewalls across 55 countries between January 11 and February 18, 2026. The attacker did not exploit any zero-day vulnerabilities but instead abused exposed management ports (e.g., 443, 8443) and weak single-factor credentials (e.g., default admin:admin) to gain access. AI was used to automate credential stuffing, reconnaissance, and lateral movement across misconfigured devices.\n\nParagraph 2: This campaign marks a dangerous shift toward AI-augmented, low-skill-barrier attacks that dramatically scale infrastructure compromise. Fortinet customers—especially those with internet-facing firewalls lacking MFA or network segmentation—are at high risk. The breach enables full network surveillance, credential theft, and potential pivot into downstream cloud or on-prem assets. Immediate actions include disabling unused management interfaces, enforcing MFA, and conducting credential audits.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A new supply chain worm campaign codenamed SANDWORM_MODE has been detected targeting the npm registry, leveraging at least 19 malicious packages to exfiltrate CI/CD secrets, cryptocurrency wallet keys, and internal API tokens. The malware propagates like a worm—automatically infecting dependent packages—and includes a destructive dead switch. Researchers at Socket identified it as inspired by the Shai-Hulud campaign, with added AI-assisted obfuscation and evasion techniques to bypass npm’s security filters.\n\nParagraph 2: This attack represents a high-impact evolution in software supply chain threats, moving beyond static backdoors to self-replicating, intelligence-gathering malware. Developers and DevOps teams using npm are at immediate risk, especially those with exposed CI/CD pipelines or shared credentials. Organizations must enforce strict package vetting, use private registries with signature verification, and rotate secrets post-incident. The worm’s ability to persist across dependencies makes remediation complex and time-sensitive.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Attackers have discovered a novel abuse of GitHub Issues to inject malicious instructions into Copilot Codespaces. When a user launches a Codespace from a compromised GitHub Issue, the malicious content—disguised as a comment or metadata—triggers automatic execution of arbitrary commands. This allows attackers to exfiltrate repository contents, steal GitHub tokens, and hijack Codespace environments. The attack chain exploits GitHub’s native integration between Issues and Codespaces, bypassing traditional code-review safeguards.\n\nParagraph 2: This vulnerability undermines trust in GitHub’s developer platform, especially for organizations relying on Copilot for rapid prototyping. Any public or private repository linked to a maliciously crafted Issue is at risk. Microsoft has issued an emergency patch, but developers must audit recent Issues and revoke compromised tokens. The incident highlights the growing risk of AI-assisted tooling being weaponized for lateral movement and credential theft in developer ecosystems.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: The Everest ransomware group claimed responsibility for breaching Catalyst RCM, a third-party revenue cycle management provider for Vikor Scientific (now Vanta Diagnostics), resulting in the theft of data for 139,964 individuals. The attackers gained access via a misused authorized login between November 8–9, 2025, copying sensitive patient records—including names, DOBs, diagnoses, and insurance details—before adding Vikor Scientific to their Tor data leak site.\n\nParagraph 2: This incident exemplifies the growing risk of secondary supply chain breaches in healthcare, where attackers target vendors to access high-value patient data. Vikor Scientific’s affiliated labs (KorPath, Korgene) are now also impacted. Healthcare providers must enforce strict vendor risk assessments, limit third-party access via zero-trust principles, and monitor for credential misuse. The breach also triggers HIPAA reporting obligations and potential regulatory fines.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: CISA has added two RoundCube Webmail vulnerabilities—CVE-2026-24972 and CVE-2026-24973—to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, citing active exploitation in the wild. One flaw enables XSS via SVG animate tags, while the other allows remote code execution through deserialization of untrusted data (CVE-2025-49113, CVSS 9.9). APT groups including APT28 and Winter Vivern have historically exploited RoundCube flaws to harvest credentials and monitor communications.\n\nParagraph 2: With CISA mandating federal agencies to patch within 3 weeks, this underscores the severity and active threat landscape. Organizations using RoundCube—especially email providers, government agencies, and universities—must prioritize patching and implement network segmentation to limit lateral movement. Unpatched instances remain high-value targets for espionage and credential theft, particularly where email serves as a central intelligence hub.",

The malware leverages iOS jailbreak exploits and Android accessibility services to bypass sandboxing, and includes anti-analysis features to evade detection by consumer antivirus tools.\n\nParagraph 2: Its availability as a MaaS significantly lowers the barrier for financially motivated attackers to target individuals and small businesses. Users of high-value apps (e.g., banking, cryptocurrency, messaging) are primary targets. Mobile device management (MDM) solutions must enforce strict app installation policies, and users should avoid third-party app stores. The campaign highlights the growing threat of mobile surveillance tools being commoditized and weaponized at scale.",
