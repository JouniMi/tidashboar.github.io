      "title": "APT28 Abuses Webhook Infrastructure for Covert Data Exfiltration in Macro Malware Campaign",
      "date": "2026-02-24T09:10:39Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Russia-linked APT28 (aka Fancy Bear) launched Operation MacroMaze, a supply chain–style campaign targeting European entities from September 2025 to January 2026. Attackers delivered weaponized Microsoft Word documents via spear-phishing, embedding malicious INCLUDEPICTURE fields pointing to webhook[.]site URLs hosting JPG files. These files triggered macro execution, which then exfiltrated data via HTTP POST requests to legitimate webhook services, evading traditional network detection.\n\nParagraph 2: The campaign demonstrates APT28’s shift toward infrastructure abuse—leveraging widely trusted third-party services (e.g., webhook sites) to avoid direct C2 infrastructure and reduce forensic traceability. This approach increases stealth and sustainability, posing significant risk to government, defense, and critical infrastructure sectors in Western and Central Europe.",

      "date": "2026-02-24T11:52:00Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: North Korea’s Lazarus Group (aka Diamond Sleet, Pompilus) has begun using Medusa ransomware—a RaaS platform operated by Spearwing—in attacks against at least one U.S. healthcare organization and an unnamed entity in the Middle East. Researchers from Symantec and Carbon Black confirmed the deployment via forensic analysis and IOCs, noting Lazarus’s strategic pivot toward profit-driven ransomware alongside traditional espionage objectives.\n\nParagraph 2: This marks a significant escalation, as Medusa is known for aggressive data theft, double-extortion tactics, and integration with other Lazarus tools. Healthcare and critical infrastructure sectors are now at heightened risk, especially given the group’s history of targeting global supply chains and its increasing reliance on monetization to fund state programs.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A Russian-speaking financially motivated threat actor used commercial generative AI tools to compromise over 600 internet-exposed FortiGate firewalls across 55 countries between January 11 and February 18, 2026. The attacker did not exploit zero-day flaws but instead abused exposed management ports (e.g., 443, 8443) and weak single-factor credentials—automating credential stuffing and reconnaissance via AI to scale the attack.\n\nParagraph 2: This campaign underscores the dangerous democratization of cyberattack capabilities: low-skill actors can now achieve high-impact breaches using off-the-shelf AI tools. Compromised firewalls enable man-in-the-middle attacks, lateral movement, and infrastructure hijacking—posing severe risks to enterprises, critical infrastructure, and cloud environments.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: The ShinyHunters extortion group leaked data from over 12.4 million CarGurus accounts—including names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, IP addresses, and auto finance application results—after a failed ransom demand. Separately, the group stole employee data from Wynn Resorts and later removed it from its leak site, prompting the company to accept the group’s assurance that data was deleted.\n\nParagraph 2: These breaches highlight ShinyHunters’ continued notoriety and the growing trend of threat actors using data theft as leverage without demanding payment. CarGurus’ public listing and Wynn Resorts’ high-net-worth clientele make them high-value targets, raising concerns about identity theft, financial fraud, and insider threats.",

The vulnerabilities affect on-premises deployments widely used by enterprises for secure file exchange.\n\nParagraph 2: Given Serv-U’s prevalence in high-value environments (e.g., finance, healthcare, government), unpatched systems remain at severe risk of full server compromise, data exfiltration, and ransomware deployment. Organizations must prioritize patching immediately, especially as CISA may add these flaws to its KEV catalog.",

Williams pleaded guilty to trade secret theft in October 2025; the exploits were reportedly used to target Microsoft, Apple, and other high-value platforms.\n\nParagraph 2: This case—paired with U.S. sanctions on Operation Zero—reveals a thriving black market for zero-day exploits, directly enabling state-sponsored cyber operations. The sentencing sends a strong deterrent message but also confirms that insider threats from defense contractors remain a critical vulnerability in national cybersecurity.",

The packages exfiltrate sensitive ASP.NET Identity data—including user accounts, role assignments, and permission mappings—and manipulate authorization rules to embed persistent backdoors in victim applications.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain attack compromises the integrity of enterprise web apps built on Microsoft’s .NET framework, potentially exposing millions of users. Since NuGet is a trusted package manager, developers may unknowingly integrate malicious code into production systems, making detection difficult and impact widespread.",

The flaw allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary OS commands via crafted HTTP requests, enabling full system compromise.\n\nParagraph 2: FileZen is used by government and enterprise agencies for secure file transfer, making exploitation highly consequential. With active exploitation confirmed, agencies must patch within 30 days per CISA binding operational directive, or risk data theft and lateral movement by APTs.",
