      "title": "APT28 Conducts Macro-Based Webhook Malware Campaign Targeting European Entities",
      "date": "2026-02-23T19:41:00Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: APT28 (Fancy Bear), a Russia-linked state-sponsored group, executed Operation MacroMaze between September 2025 and January 2026, targeting European government and defense entities. The campaign used macro-enabled Word documents delivered via phishing emails, which leveraged webhook-based redirection to download and execute malware—bypassing traditional email security controls by avoiding direct payload delivery. The malware, named MacroMaze, establishes persistence and exfiltrates data via HTTP POST requests to compromised or repurposed legitimate services.\n\nParagraph 2: The operation highlights APT28’s continued evolution toward infrastructure abuse and evasion techniques, particularly by exploiting trusted web services for command-and-control (C2). This approach increases stealth and reduces detection likelihood, posing significant risk to European institutions handling sensitive political, military, or diplomatic information. The use of webhooks also demonstrates a shift toward lighter, more resilient malware architectures that evade endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems.",

      "title": "AI-Powered Campaign Compromises 600+ FortiGate Firewalls Across 55 Countries",
      "date": "2026-02-23T11:41:47Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A Russian-speaking financially motivated threat actor used commercial generative AI tools to compromise over 600 internet-exposed FortiGate firewalls across 55 countries between January 11 and February 18, 2026. According to Amazon Threat Intelligence, the attacker did not exploit software vulnerabilities but instead abused exposed management ports (e.g., 443, 8443) and weak single-factor credentials—often obtained via credential stuffing or leaked databases. AI was used to automate reconnaissance, credential testing, and post-exploitation enumeration.\n\nParagraph 2: This campaign represents a dangerous new paradigm: AI-augmented infrastructure abuse, where attackers scale attacks without zero-day exploits. Compromised firewalls enable man-in-the-middle attacks, lateral movement, and network surveillance across critical infrastructure, healthcare, and financial sectors. The incident underscores the risk of misconfigured cloud-deployed security appliances and the growing threat of AI-powered credential-based attacks.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Malicious skills (plugins) for the open-source AI agent OpenClaw (formerly ClawdBot) were weaponized to distribute the AMOS macOS infostealer. The campaign exploits OpenClaw’s extensibility by publishing deceptive skills on public repositories that, when installed, silently exfiltrate browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallet files, and system metadata. Trend Micro researchers traced the payload to a new variant of the AMOS stealer, which uses obfuscated JavaScript and base64-encoded payloads to evade static analysis.\n\nParagraph 2: This marks the first known large-scale supply chain abuse of an autonomous AI agent infrastructure. With OpenClaw marketed as a legitimate personal digital assistant, attackers gained access to high-value targets—including developers, executives, and crypto users—by piggybacking on trusted AI workflows. The incident reveals how open AI ecosystems can become vectors for stealthy, persistent data theft if skill verification and sandboxing are inadequate.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Threat actors are actively exploiting CVE-2026-1731 (CVSS 9.9), a critical unauthenticated remote code execution flaw in BeyondTrust Remote Support (RS) and Privileged Remote Access (PRA) products. The vulnerability allows attackers to deploy VShell and other tools to gain persistence, move laterally, and maintain persistent remote control. Since the patch was released on February 6, 2026, exploitation has been observed globally—often following initial access via phishing or compromised credentials.\n\nParagraph 2: The abuse of this vulnerability enables full compromise of privileged access management (PAM) infrastructure, which is foundational to Zero Trust architectures. Organizations relying on BeyondTrust for secure remote access—including government agencies, healthcare providers, and Fortune 500 companies—are at severe risk of credential theft, data exfiltration, and ransomware deployment. CISA’s inclusion of this flaw in its KEV catalog underscores its operational significance.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: The Iranian APT MuddyWater (aka Earth Vetala, Mango Sandstorm) launched Operation Olalampo starting January 26, 2026, targeting government, telecom, energy, and media organizations across the Middle East and North Africa. The campaign deployed three new malware families: GhostFetch (a Cobalt Strike alternative), CHAR (a credential harvester), and HTTP_VIP (a custom backdoor). Infection vectors include spear-phishing with malicious Office documents and compromised software updates.\n\nParagraph 2: This operation demonstrates MuddyWater’s expanding tradecraft, including the development of custom tooling to reduce reliance on well-known frameworks like Cobalt Strike. The focus on MENA aligns with Iran’s strategic influence goals, and the use of HTTP_VIP—designed to mimic legitimate HTTP traffic—enables long-term espionage with low detection probability. Organizations in the region must prioritize endpoint detection, network traffic analysis, and identity-based access controls.",

      "date": "2026-02-23T18:36:09Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A wormable cryptojacking campaign spreads via pirated software bundles, leveraging a Bring-Your-Own-VDI (BYOVD) exploit and a time-based logic bomb to deploy a custom XMRig miner. The infection chain begins with a dropper binary named Explorer.exe, which acts as a persistent state machine—switching roles (installer, watchdog, miner, cleanup) via command-line arguments. The BYOVD technique abuses legitimate driver signing bypasses to load kernel-mode payloads, while the logic bomb delays full mining activation to evade behavioral analysis.\n\nParagraph 2: This campaign highlights the resurgence of financially motivated, infrastructure-abuse attacks targeting under-protected endpoints, especially in developing economies where pirated software is common. The wormable nature enables rapid lateral movement across local networks, and the miner’s instability can cause system crashes—posing operational risks to businesses and critical services. The use of BYOVD also indicates deep OS-level expertise, raising concerns about future APT-style financial operations.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A typosquatting campaign registered huoronga[.]com—a near-perfect clone of the legitimate Huorong Security (huorong.cn)—to distribute ValleyRAT, a sophisticated Windows-based Remote Access Trojan. The site serves a trojanized NSIS installer that deploys a full-featured backdoor with advanced user-mode stealth and process injection capabilities. The campaign is attributed to the Silver Fox APT group, known for distributing malware via localized, software-piracy channels in mainland China.\n\nParagraph 2: This attack exploits trust in local security tools and capitalizes on language and UI mimicry to deceive users. Given Huorong’s popularity among Chinese consumers and small businesses, the campaign has high potential reach. ValleyRAT’s capabilities—including keylogging, screen capture, and credential theft—make it ideal for espionage or financial fraud. The incident underscores the risk of supply chain compromise in region-specific software ecosystems.",

The flaws enable XSS and deserialization attacks, allowing unauthenticated attackers to steal session tokens and execute arbitrary code. Evidence shows active exploitation by APT groups including APT28 and Winter Vivern, who use the vulnerabilities to spy on diplomatic and military communications.\n\nParagraph 2: RoundCube is widely deployed in government and enterprise environments due to its open-source nature and low cost, but many instances remain unpatched. The KEV listing reflects urgent operational risk: compromised mailboxes can lead to credential theft, lateral movement, and intelligence harvesting. This incident reinforces the need for automated patch management and network segmentation for email infrastructure.",
