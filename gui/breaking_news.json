      "title": "OpenClaw AI Agent Secrets Stolen by Infostealer Malware",
      "date": "2026-02-16T18:43:00Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Cybersecurity researchers discovered that infostealer malware has successfully exfiltrated OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot/Moltbot) configuration files, including API keys, authentication tokens, and internal secrets. This marks the first known instance of infostealers targeting AI agent development environments rather than traditional browser credentials.\n\nParagraph 2: The theft of OpenClaw’s configuration data compromises the integrity of AI agent deployments, enabling attackers to impersonate legitimate agents, intercept communications, or deploy malicious behaviors. This represents a critical shift in infostealer capabilities toward stealing digital identities and operational tooling used in next-generation AI infrastructure.",

      "date": "2026-02-16T13:09:37Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: The ClickFix threat group has evolved its social engineering tactics to abuse the built-in Windows nslookup utility to smuggle and execute second-stage payloads via DNS queries. Instead of relying solely on PowerShell or mshta, attackers trick victims into running malicious nslookup commands that parse DNS responses to retrieve RAT payloads like ModeloRAT.\n\nParagraph 2: This technique bypasses traditional endpoint security controls that block PowerShell and script execution, significantly expanding ClickFix’s evasion capabilities. Microsoft and Malwarebytes have confirmed active exploitation, affecting enterprise and consumer endpoints globally.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Google released emergency updates for Chrome to patch CVE-2026-2441, a high-severity (CVSS 8.8) use-after-free vulnerability in the CSS component actively exploited in the wild. Security researcher Shaheen Fazim responsibly disclosed the flaw on February 11, 2026, and exploitation allowed remote code execution within the browser sandbox.\n\nParagraph 2: As the first Chrome zero-day exploited in 2026, this vulnerability poses immediate risk to all Chrome users—especially high-value targets like executives, journalists, and activists—given Chrome’s dominance in enterprise and consumer environments.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Researchers identified malicious npm and PyPI packages linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group as part of a long-running fake recruitment campaign named “graphalgo.” The campaign, active since May 2025, uses deceptive job offers to trick developers into installing infected packages containing backdoors and credential stealers.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain attack targets the software development lifecycle, enabling lateral movement and persistent access to corporate networks. Given Lazarus’s history of high-impact financial and infrastructure attacks, this campaign significantly raises the risk for tech companies and financial institutions using open-source tooling.",
