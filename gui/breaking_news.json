      "title": "Lazarus Group Adopts Medusa Ransomware in Healthcare Attacks",
      "date": "2026-02-24T18:25:04Z",
      "summary": "North Korea–backed Lazarus Group has begun using the Medusa ransomware in targeted attacks against U.S. healthcare organizations and at least one Middle Eastern entity. According to Symantec and Carbon Black, the group deployed Medusa in extortion campaigns, indicating a strategic shift toward profit-driven cybercrime while retaining its APT roots.\n\nThis development is significant because Medusa is a relatively new ransomware strain with capabilities to encrypt data, exfiltrate sensitive health records, and apply pressure through double-extortion tactics. The targeting of healthcare infrastructure heightens risk to patient safety and operational continuity, especially given the sector’s historically weak cybersecurity posture and high sensitivity to downtime.",

      "date": "2026-02-23T10:39:40Z",
      "summary": "A Russian-speaking financially motivated threat actor used commercial generative AI tools to compromise over 600 internet-exposed FortiGate firewalls across 55 countries between January 11 and February 18, 2026. The attacker did not exploit zero-day vulnerabilities but instead abused exposed management ports and weak single-factor credentials, using AI to automate credential stuffing and reconnaissance.\n\nThis campaign demonstrates how off-the-shelf AI tools can dramatically lower the barrier to large-scale infrastructure compromise, enabling low-skill actors to achieve high-impact breaches. Compromised firewalls can serve as pivot points for lateral movement, data theft, or further ransomware deployment—posing systemic risk to critical infrastructure and enterprise networks worldwide.",

      "summary": "Russia-linked APT28 conducted Operation MacroMaze from September 2025 to January 2026, targeting European entities using spear-phishing emails with weaponized Microsoft Word documents containing INCLUDEPICTURE fields pointing to webhook[.]site URLs. These fields triggered remote image downloads that executed macro-based malware, exfiltrating data via legitimate webhook services to evade detection.\n\nThe campaign highlights APT28’s continued reliance on living-off-the-land techniques and abuse of trusted infrastructure (e.g., Microsoft services and webhook APIs) to maintain stealth. This approach complicates attribution and detection, as traffic mimics legitimate user behavior and bypasses traditional security controls focused on known malicious domains or binaries.",

      "date": "2026-02-24T18:52:00Z",
      "summary": "A vulnerability in GitHub Codespaces—codenamed RoguePilot—allowed attackers to inject hidden malicious instructions into GitHub Issues, which were then automatically executed by GitHub Copilot when developers launched a Codespace from the compromised issue. This enabled full repository takeover, including code modification and secret theft.\n\nThe flaw underscores the novel risks introduced by AI-assisted development tools: autonomous agents processing untrusted inputs (e.g., issue descriptions) can become attack vectors. Although patched after responsible disclosure, the incident reveals how AI integration into CI/CD pipelines can expand the attack surface and enable supply chain compromises at the developer level.",

The campaign mimics the tactics of the infamous Shai-Hulud attacks, targeting CI/CD pipelines and developer environments to maximize lateral movement and data theft.\n\nThis attack represents a significant escalation in supply chain targeting, as it leverages AI-assisted tooling to manipulate AI assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot), potentially corrupting future code generations. Organizations relying on open-source dependencies and AI-assisted development face heightened risk of silent, persistent compromise.",

The other flaws enable unauthenticated remote code execution and privilege escalation.\n\nGiven Serv-U’s widespread use in enterprise environments for secure file transfers—including sensitive data exchange between internal teams and external partners—unpatched systems remain at severe risk of full infrastructure compromise. Attackers could leverage these flaws to pivot into core networks, deploy ransomware, or exfiltrate large volumes of data.",

While specifics remain limited, the breach likely involved credential stuffing or phishing to gain initial access, followed by lateral movement to exfiltrate internal HR data.\n\nThis incident highlights the growing threat from ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups like ShinyHunters, which increasingly target high-value sectors such as hospitality and gaming—industries with large employee databases and often less rigorous security postures than tech or finance. The breach could enable credential reuse, insider threat facilitation, or social engineering attacks against employees.",

      "summary": "The ShinyHunters group published data allegedly stolen from CarGurus, exposing over 12.4 million user records—including names, email addresses, and hashed passwords—on its Tor leak site. The breach likely originated from a compromised third-party service or misconfigured database, as CarGurus is a major U.S. digital auto marketplace with high-value user data.\n\nThe exposure of 12+ million records significantly increases phishing and credential-stuffing risks for consumers, especially given the sensitive financial and personal information often associated with auto-buying platforms. This breach adds to a growing trend of large-scale compromises targeting consumer-facing platforms, enabling mass identity fraud and account takeover.",
