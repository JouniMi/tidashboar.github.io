      "title": "Dell RecoverPoint Zero-Day Exploited by China-Linked APT Since Mid-2024",
      "date": "2026-02-18T12:15:46Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A suspected China-linked APT group (UNC6201) exploited a critical hardcoded-credential vulnerability (CVE-2026-22769, CVSS 10.0) in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines as a zero-day starting in mid-2024. The flaw enabled lateral movement, persistence, and deployment of malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and GRIMBOLT. Mandiant and Google GTIG confirmed the active exploitation through incident response engagements, noting the attackers used ‘ghost NICs’ to evade detection.\n\nParagraph 2: This attack targets critical infrastructure and enterprise environments where Dell RecoverPoint is used for data replication and disaster recovery—making it a high-impact supply chain compromise. Organizations relying on Dell storage infrastructure are at severe risk of long-term persistence and data exfiltration. The prolonged zero-day window (nearly two years) underscores the danger of unpatched high-severity flaws in backup and recovery systems.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Notepad++ patched a vulnerability (CVE-2026-25926) after a China-linked APT group compromised its hosting provider’s infrastructure to hijack the software’s update mechanism. Attackers redirected update traffic to malicious servers, selectively delivering malware to targeted users—without exploiting code flaws in Notepad++ itself. The maintainer confirmed the compromise occurred at the infrastructure layer, not in the application code.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain attack affects millions of Notepad++ users globally, particularly developers and enterprise environments where the tool is widely used. The selective targeting suggests nation-state espionage operations. The incident highlights how attackers are shifting focus from application vulnerabilities to third-party infrastructure (e.g., hosting providers) to compromise widely deployed software.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A hacker accessed data from 1.2 million French bank accounts using stolen credentials of a government official, gaining access to a national bank account database containing names, addresses, bank account numbers, and in some cases, tax IDs. The breach occurred from late January through mid-February 2026 and was confirmed by the French Economy Ministry.\n\nParagraph 2: This incident demonstrates the severe risk of credential theft targeting government personnel with privileged access to financial infrastructure. Affected individuals face heightened risks of identity theft, financial fraud, and targeted phishing. The breach undermines trust in national financial data systems and signals a shift toward insider credential-based attacks against critical infrastructure.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Four popular Visual Studio Code extensions—including Live Server, Code Runner, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Microsoft Live Preview—contain critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-65715, CVE-2025-65716, CVE-2025-65717) that allow remote code execution and local file theft. Collectively installed over 125 million times, these flaws enable attackers to perform lateral movement across developer environments and compromise entire organizational codebases.\n\nParagraph 2: Developers and enterprises using VS Code are at extreme risk, especially given the extensions’ broad adoption and privileged access to local systems. Since these extensions often run with user-level permissions, exploitation can lead to theft of source code, API keys, and credentials. This represents a high-impact software supply chain risk in one of the most widely used developer tools.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Kaspersky uncovered Keenadu, a sophisticated Android backdoor embedded in device firmware during manufacturing or delivered via signed OTA updates. It hooks into Zygote to infect every app launched on the device, enabling ad fraud, credential theft, and full remote control. Variants have been found on devices from brands including Alldocube and distributed through Google Play.\n\nParagraph 2: This firmware-level compromise affects thousands of end-user devices globally and represents a new evolution in mobile malware that bypasses traditional app sandboxing. Because Keenadu embeds itself before OS boot, it evades detection by most endpoint security tools and persists across reboots and factory resets. The use of signed OTA updates further increases trust and infection success.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Researchers demonstrated that AI assistants like Microsoft Copilot and xAI Grok—with web browsing and URL-fetching capabilities—can be weaponized as stealthy command-and-control (C2) relays. Attackers route malware traffic through these services, blending into legitimate user activity and evading network-based detection. The technique leverages trusted endpoints and encrypted HTTPS traffic to hide malicious payloads.\n\nParagraph 2: This abuse significantly expands the attack surface for enterprise environments where AI tools are increasingly adopted. Organizations relying on these platforms for productivity may unknowingly facilitate malware communication, undermining traditional network security controls. The method is low-friction for attackers and hard to detect without deep behavioral analysis of AI tool usage.",

They built fake GitHub repositories with fabricated contributors and forks to mimic legitimacy, tricking developers into downloading trojanized versions.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain attack targets developers and AI tool users, compromising developer credentials, browser passwords, and cryptocurrency wallets. It exemplifies how threat actors exploit trust in open-source AI infrastructure and legitimate health-tech integrations. The campaign shows increasing sophistication in impersonating emerging AI ecosystems to maximize infection rates.",

The flaw (CVE-2024-XXXXX) enables attackers to bypass authentication and gain control over physical security infrastructure—potentially disabling surveillance or capturing sensitive footage.\n\nParagraph 2: Critical infrastructure sites (e.g., power plants, government facilities) using Honeywell CCTV systems are at high risk. Compromised cameras could be used for reconnaissance in physical attacks or to disable security monitoring. This vulnerability highlights the growing threat to operational technology (OT) and physical security systems, especially where legacy devices lack robust patching processes.",

Leaked files include retirement plan details, financial interests, internal meeting notes, and pipeline data—far beyond typical contact info.\n\nParagraph 2: Shiny Hunters, the ransomware group behind the breach, claims Betterment refused to pay a ransom and is now publishing the data. Affected customers face high-risk financial fraud, identity theft, and targeted social engineering. The breach underscores the danger of third-party vendor compromises and the increasing sophistication of ransomware groups in harvesting contextual financial intelligence.",

The flaw enables code execution without authentication, making it trivial to exploit at scale—especially in enterprise environments where devices often lack network segmentation.\n\nParagraph 2: Organizations using Grandstream VoIP phones for business communications are at immediate risk. Attackers could intercept calls, record conversations, or pivot into internal networks via compromised endpoints. Given the widespread use of these devices in contact centers and enterprises, this vulnerability poses a high risk for eavesdropping and lateral movement attacks.",
