      "title": "Dell RecoverPoint Zero-Day Exploited by China-Linked APT Since Mid-2024",
      "date": "2026-02-18T12:15:46Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A suspected China-linked APT group, identified as UNC6201, has been actively exploiting a maximum-severity (CVSS 10.0) hardcoded credential vulnerability (CVE-2026-22769) in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines since at least mid-2024. The flaw enables lateral movement, persistence, and deployment of advanced malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and GRIMBOLT. Attackers used ‘ghost NICs’ to evade detection and maintain long-term access to victim environments.\n\nParagraph 2: This long-running zero-day campaign affects enterprise customers relying on Dell RecoverPoint for data protection and disaster recovery—particularly in critical infrastructure, finance, and healthcare sectors. The prolonged undetected exploitation highlights the risk of supply chain trust assumptions and underscores the need for continuous vulnerability monitoring and network segmentation. Organizations using Dell RecoverPoint are urged to apply patches immediately and conduct forensic reviews.",

      "title": "Notepad++ Update Mechanism Hijacked via Hosting Provider Compromise",
      "date": "2026-02-18T19:28:02Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A China-linked APT group compromised Notepad++’s update infrastructure by hijacking its hosting provider, redirecting legitimate update traffic to malicious servers. The attack did not exploit a flaw in Notepad++’s source code but instead intercepted updates before delivery, selectively pushing malware to targeted users. The Notepad++ maintainer confirmed the compromise occurred at the infrastructure layer and released version 8.9.2 with a hardened 'double-lock' update verification process.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain attack impacts millions of developers and enterprise users globally who rely on Notepad++—a widely used open-source text editor. The selective targeting suggests high-value espionage objectives, and the infrastructure-level compromise demonstrates a shift toward compromising third-party hosting rather than code-level injection. The incident reinforces the urgency of verifying software integrity via cryptographic signatures and supply chain risk management.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Google patched a high-severity (CVSS 8.8) use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome’s CSS component (CVE-2026-2441) after it was actively exploited in the wild—the first Chrome zero-day of 2026. Security researcher Shaheen Fazim responsibly disclosed the flaw on February 11, 2026. The vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution inside the Chrome sandbox via a malicious webpage, allowing full system compromise.\n\nParagraph 2: All Chrome users on Windows, macOS, and Linux are at risk, with exploitation likely targeting high-value individuals (journalists, activists, executives) and enterprise environments. CISA added the flaw to its KEV catalog, mandating federal agency patching within three days. The rapid weaponization and inclusion in the KEV list indicate active threat actor interest, making immediate patching critical across all organizations.",

Attackers built fake GitHub repositories with forged forks and contributors to lend credibility, tricking developers into downloading a trojanized version. Once installed, the malware steals browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and developer API keys.\n\nParagraph 2: This attack exploits trust in AI development tooling and open-source ecosystems, targeting developers and AI researchers who use MCP-based integrations. The campaign signals a new trend: weaponizing AI infrastructure itself to compromise the builders of AI. Organizations using AI agent frameworks must verify package authenticity via signed releases and monitor for anomalous network behavior from local AI services.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Kaspersky discovered Keenadu, a sophisticated Android backdoor embedded in device firmware during manufacturing—similar to Triada. It infects devices via preinstallation, signed OTA updates, or even Google Play, then hooks into Zygote to compromise every app launched on the device. Variants enable ad fraud, credential theft, remote control, and payload delivery, with some targeting Alldocube tablets.\n\nParagraph 2: Millions of consumers and enterprise users are potentially exposed, especially in regions where counterfeit or low-cost devices dominate. Firmware-level persistence makes remediation nearly impossible without reflashing or replacing devices. This represents a major escalation in mobile supply chain attacks and demands stricter OEM/ODM security audits and runtime integrity checks.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: OX Security researchers identified critical vulnerabilities in four widely used VS Code extensions—Live Server, Code Runner, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Microsoft Live Preview—with over 125 million combined installs. Three received CVEs (CVE-2025-65715, CVE-2025-65716, CVE-2025-65717) and could allow attackers to steal local files and execute arbitrary code remotely via malicious extensions or compromised CI/CD pipelines.\n\nParagraph 2: Developers and enterprises using these extensions face severe risk of lateral movement, source code theft, and supply chain poisoning. The extensions’ broad adoption means the blast radius is massive, especially in organizations where developers have elevated permissions. Microsoft and extension maintainers must prioritize patches, while users should disable or replace affected extensions until fixed.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A hacker accessed data from 1.2 million French bank accounts by using stolen credentials of a government official to query a national bank account database. Since late January, the attacker retrieved personal data—including account numbers, names, addresses, and in some cases, tax IDs—without breaching the banks’ core systems directly.\n\nParagraph 2: This incident highlights the growing risk of credential theft and insider threat exploitation in financial infrastructure. Affected individuals will be notified, but the breach undermines confidence in centralized government-access systems. It underscores the need for stricter access controls, continuous monitoring of privileged queries, and mandatory MFA for all government-facing APIs.",

The stolen data included API keys, gateway tokens, and agent settings, effectively allowing attackers to hijack the victim’s AI identity and permissions.\n\nParagraph 2: This marks a pivotal shift in threat actor tradecraft: moving from credential harvesting to stealing digital identities of AI agents. As AI agents gain access to corporate data, financial systems, and communication channels, compromising their configurations grants attackers autonomous, high-privilege access. Organizations deploying agentic AI must treat agent credentials as crown-jewel secrets and enforce strict secrets management.",
