      "title": "Microsoft Outlook Add-in Hijacked to Steal 4,000+ Credentials",
      "date": "2026-02-11T21:53:58Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A malicious actor hijacked the legitimate Outlook add-in AgreeTo—originally an open-source meeting scheduler—by claiming its expired Vercel subdomain (outlook-one.vercel.app) after the developer abandoned it. Because Microsoft only validates the add-in manifest at submission and does not monitor runtime changes, attackers repurposed the add-in to load a phishing kit in Outlook’s sidebar, exploiting the ReadWriteItem permission to harvest Microsoft account credentials and payment data.\n\nParagraph 2: Over 4,000 Microsoft credentials and payment-related security answers were compromised. This incident demonstrates a critical supply chain vulnerability in Microsoft’s add-in ecosystem, where trusted infrastructure (Vercel) and lax runtime integrity checks enabled abuse of a previously legitimate application. Organizations relying on Microsoft 365 add-ins face elevated risk of credential theft via domain expiration hijacking.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Apple patched CVE-2026-20700, a memory corruption vulnerability in the Dynamic Link Editor (dyld) affecting iOS versions since 1.0. Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered the flaw was actively exploited in an “extremely sophisticated attack” against specific high-value targets, likely by nation-state or commercial spyware actors. The exploit chain combined CVE-2026-20700 with previously patched flaws CVE-2025-14174 and CVE-2025-43529 to achieve arbitrary code execution without user interaction.\n\nParagraph 2: The vulnerability enabled full device compromise—including spyware deployment and persistent access—on affected iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS devices. Its decade-long presence and active exploitation indicate a high-risk zero-day held by advanced threat actors, likely for intelligence gathering. Users remain vulnerable until they update to patched versions, underscoring the urgency of patching for high-profile targets.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group launched a coordinated supply chain campaign, codenamed graphalgo, by publishing malicious packages across npm and PyPI. These packages—disguised as fake recruitment tools—were designed to deploy credential stealers and remote access trojans. The campaign has been active since May 2025 and leverages social engineering via fake job offers to诱导 developers into installing compromised packages.\n\nParagraph 2: Developers and enterprises using public package registries are at risk, especially those with CI/CD pipelines that auto-install dependencies. Successful compromise enables persistent access, credential theft, and lateral movement within development and production environments. This attack highlights the growing threat of supply chain poisoning via open-source ecosystems, where trust in third-party libraries becomes an attack vector for APTs.",

Following public release of a proof-of-concept exploit, attackers began targeting unpatched appliances to gain remote code execution without authentication, enabling full system compromise and lateral movement.\n\nParagraph 2: Organizations using BeyondTrust appliances for privileged access management—including Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and critical infrastructure—are at immediate risk. Successful exploitation could lead to domain dominance, credential theft, and ransomware deployment. The active exploitation and public PoC make this a top-priority patch for defenders managing privileged infrastructure.",

These extensions exfiltrate sensitive data including API keys, email messages, browsing history, and stored credentials. Many remain available on the Chrome Web Store, exploiting Google’s delayed review and takedown processes.\n\nParagraph 2: Individual users and enterprises using Chrome are at risk, especially those with developers or cloud admins whose API keys and credentials are harvested. The campaign exemplifies the weaponization of AI hype for social engineering, where users are lured by promises of AI assistance into installing malicious extensions. This highlights systemic weaknesses in browser extension vetting and the growing trend of AI-themed phishing.",

The breach also impacted subsidiary Ben. Odido terminated unauthorized access quickly and engaged external cybersecurity experts for incident response.\n\nParagraph 2: The breach represents one of the largest telecom-related compromises in Europe, affecting individuals across the Netherlands and potentially neighboring regions. While passwords and billing data were spared, the exposure of ID and banking information heightens risks for identity theft and financial fraud. This incident underscores the growing threat to telcos as high-value targets for credential and identity theft campaigns.",

The breach compromised names, Social Security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, and health/insurance information. Volvo Group North America confirmed nearly 17,000 of its employees were impacted, with data stolen from benefits-related records.\n\nParagraph 2: As a major third-party HR and benefits administrator, Conduent’s breach creates cascading risk across its enterprise clients, including automotive, healthcare, and government sectors. The scale and sensitivity of the data (including SSNs and health records) make this a high-impact supply chain breach, with long-term identity theft and fraud risks for victims.

APT31 leveraged Gemini to distill public vulnerability data into actionable attack vectors, while UNC2970 used AI for social engineering content generation and phishing campaign optimization.\n\nParagraph 2: This marks a significant escalation in AI-enabled cyber operations, where threat actors use generative AI to accelerate the kill chain—reducing time-to-attack and increasing scalability. The use of commercial AI models by state-sponsored actors raises concerns about model abuse, data poisoning, and the democratization of advanced cyber capabilities. Defenders must now account for AI-augmented tradecraft in threat modeling and detection strategies.",

      "date": "2026-02-11T15:00:47Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Researchers discovered Reynolds ransomware, a new family that embeds a Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) component—specifically the NsecSoft driver—directly into its payload to disable endpoint security tools before encryption. Unlike traditional BYOVD attacks that rely on separate tools, Reynolds bundles the vulnerable driver internally, enabling privilege escalation and defense evasion in a single stage.\n\nParagraph 2: Organizations running Windows endpoints with outdated or unpatched drivers are at heightened risk. The ransomware’s ability to disable EDR solutions in real time increases the likelihood of successful encryption and data exfiltration. This technique signals a shift toward more resilient ransomware families that integrate advanced persistence and evasion capabilities, demanding improved driver signing enforcement and runtime integrity monitoring.",

The botnet employs IRC for command-and-control—a legacy tactic—and includes capabilities for DDoS and cryptomining, though it has remained dormant so far. Researchers first detected it via SSH honeypots in early 2026.\n\nParagraph 2: The botnet’s use of obsolete vulnerabilities highlights the widespread exposure of under-maintained Linux systems, especially in cloud and IoT environments. While currently inactive operationally, SSHStalker demonstrates how outdated infrastructure can be repurposed into large-scale botnets. Its persistence without immediate impact suggests a potential “residency” strategy, where attackers prepare for future large-scale operations.",
