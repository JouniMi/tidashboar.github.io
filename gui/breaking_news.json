      "title": "DKnife AitM Framework Abuses Routers Since 2019 for Global Espionage",
      "date": "2026-02-08T10:04:33Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Cisco Talos uncovered DKnife, a Linux-based adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) framework actively used since at least 2019 to hijack router and edge device traffic. The toolkit comprises seven implants performing deep-packet inspection, traffic manipulation, and malware delivery—including ShadowPad and DarkNimbus backdoors—primarily targeting Chinese-speaking users. DKnife leverages compromised routers to intercept and alter software downloads and Android app updates in transit.\n\nParagraph 2: The campaign remains active as of January 2026, with persistent C2 infrastructure, indicating long-term espionage objectives. Its infrastructure abuse model—exploiting legitimate edge devices—enables stealthy, large-scale surveillance across telecommunications, government, defense, and financial sectors. This represents a significant shift toward network-layer compromise, bypassing endpoint security entirely.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: APT28 (Fancy Bear) is actively exploiting the newly disclosed CVE-2026-21509 vulnerability in Operation Neusploit, according to Security Affairs’ malware newsletter Round 83. The vulnerability enables initial access and persistence in targeted environments, likely in government and defense sectors. The campaign demonstrates APT28’s continued evolution toward zero-day exploitation and supply chain compromise.\n\nParagraph 2: This activity underscores the group’s capacity to weaponize unpatched flaws rapidly, increasing risk for organizations still assessing patching timelines. CVE-2026-21509’s inclusion in the KEV catalog (per Security Affairs Round 562) confirms active exploitation, demanding immediate mitigation. The operation reflects a broader trend of APTs prioritizing zero-day discovery and infrastructure-level compromise over disruptive ransomware tactics.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: China-linked APT group Amaranth-Dragon conducted targeted espionage campaigns in 2025 against government and law enforcement agencies in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines using the CVE-2025-8088 vulnerability. CheckPoint identified Amaranth Loader—a custom loader sharing code similarities with APT41 tools like Dustpan and Dusttrap—as part of the attack chain. The group employed highly stealthy techniques to avoid detection and maintain long-term access.\n\nParagraph 2: The campaign highlights the growing sophistication of regionally focused APTs conducting sustained espionage without disruption. By leveraging known vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-8088) and custom tooling, Amaranth-Dragon demonstrates alignment with broader Chinese cyber-espionage objectives. This activity poses serious risk to national security infrastructure and regional diplomatic integrity.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A previously undocumented state-aligned threat group, tracked as TGR-STA-1030/UNC6619, launched the “Shadow Campaigns” operation targeting government infrastructure in 155 countries. Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 confirmed active compromise of at least 70 government and critical infrastructure entities across 37 countries over the past year. The group uses custom tooling including a Linux kernel rootkit and leverages supply chain and credential theft techniques.\n\nParagraph 2: With a scope spanning diplomatic missions, defense, and public administration, this operation represents one of the most geographically expansive state-sponsored espionage efforts in recent years. The use of previously unseen infrastructure and tactics suggests a new actor entering the APT space—likely backed by a nation-state—with long-term intelligence-gathering goals.",

The breach occurred in October 2025 but went undetected for months before being disclosed on February 5, 2026. The company confirmed that passwords and financial data were not exposed, but the exposure of contact details enables high-fidelity phishing and social engineering attacks against a high-value user base of journalists, writers, and influencers.\n\nParagraph 2: As a platform used by millions globally—including prominent public figures—the breach significantly increases the risk of targeted disinformation campaigns and credential stuffing. The delayed detection and disclosure timeline raises concerns about Substack’s monitoring and incident response capabilities, potentially affecting trust in similar SaaS platforms.",

The attack originated from a social engineering compromise of customer support systems, allowing attackers to extract personal data—including names, email addresses, and account metadata—without accessing financial or password data. The breach was flagged by Have I Been Pwned but remains unconfirmed in full by Betterment.\n\nParagraph 2: As a financial services provider, the breach poses elevated risks for identity theft, account takeover, and targeted investment scams. The use of social engineering against support infrastructure highlights a growing trend of attackers bypassing technical defenses by targeting human processes. This incident underscores the need for stricter access controls and identity verification in customer support channels.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A ransomware gang is hosting and delivering malicious payloads at scale by compromising virtual machines provisioned through ISPsystem, a legitimate virtual infrastructure management platform. The attackers abuse ISPsystem’s VM provisioning workflows to deploy droppers and ransomware—bypassing traditional perimeter defenses by leveraging trusted infrastructure. This supply chain abuse enables rapid, large-scale deployment across hosting providers and MSPs.\n\nParagraph 2: The attack demonstrates how attackers are shifting toward infrastructure-level compromise to maximize impact while evading detection. Organizations relying on shared or outsourced virtual infrastructure are at heightened risk, especially those using ISPsystem or similar platforms without rigorous VM integrity checks. This represents a new class of “trusted host” supply chain attack with broad implications for cloud and hosting providers.",

Students and staff lost access to exam booking, tuition systems, and internal communications. The university confirmed the incident but provided no details on the ransomware strain or attacker, citing ongoing mitigation efforts.\n\nParagraph 2: The prolonged outage—still ongoing as of February 8—disrupts academic operations for tens of thousands of students and faculty, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in higher education cybersecurity. As a high-profile target with sensitive research and personal data, the attack raises concerns about ransomware actors increasingly targeting academic institutions for both financial gain and reputational leverage.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A critical sandbox escape vulnerability (CVE-2026-25049, CVSS 9.4) in the open-source workflow automation tool n8n allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on hosted servers. The flaw bypasses a previous patch (CVE-2025-68613) and enables full server compromise, credential theft, and lateral movement. Attackers with workflow creation privileges can exploit this remotely without authentication.\n\nParagraph 2: Given n8n’s widespread adoption in enterprise automation—including integrations with CI/CD pipelines, HR systems, and cloud services—the vulnerability poses severe supply chain and data integrity risks. Organizations using n8n self-hosted instances or cloud workflows must prioritize patching or disable untrusted workflow execution. This exemplifies the growing attack surface in low-code/no-code automation platforms.",

The campaign focuses on government, military, and diplomatic personnel.\n\nParagraph 2: This represents a significant escalation in AitM (adversary-in-the-middle) attacks against secure messaging platforms, undermining trust in end-to-end encrypted channels. The targeting of senior figures suggests intelligence-gathering objectives, likely by a nation-state actor. Organizations must reassess mobile account security and implement multi-factor authentication beyond SMS/SIM-based methods.",
