      "title": "Dell RecoverPoint Zero-Day Exploited by China-Linked APT Since Mid-2024",
      "date": "2026-02-18T12:15:46Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A suspected China-linked APT group, identified as UNC6201, has been actively exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2026-22769) in Dell RecoverPoint for Virtual Machines since at least mid-2024. The flaw, rated CVSS 10.0, stems from hardcoded credentials enabling unauthenticated remote code execution and lateral movement. Attackers leveraged this to deploy malware including SLAYSTYLE, BRICKSTORM, and the novel backdoor GRIMBOLT, maintaining persistent access and evading detection using 'ghost NICs'.\n\nParagraph 2: This long-running campaign impacts enterprise environments relying on Dell’s data protection infrastructure, particularly those in critical sectors like finance, healthcare, and government. The prolonged zero-day exploitation—undetected for nearly two years—highlights severe risks in supply chain and backup systems, undermining trust in enterprise data resilience tools and enabling sustained espionage and sabotage capabilities.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Notepad++ patched a critical flaw (CVE-2026-25926) after a China-linked APT group compromised its hosting provider’s infrastructure to intercept and redirect update traffic, bypassing the application itself. The attackers did not exploit code vulnerabilities but manipulated DNS or CDN routing to serve malicious payloads to targeted users selectively. The maintainer confirmed the attack was sophisticated and infrastructure-level, not a software bug.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain attack compromises one of the world’s most widely used free text editors (over 100M installations), enabling targeted malware delivery to developers, enterprises, and government users. The selective nature suggests high-value targeting, raising concerns about long-term espionage and persistence in high-impact environments where Notepad++ is embedded in development workflows.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: OX Security researchers disclosed critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-65715, CVE-2025-65716, CVE-2025-65717) in four Microsoft Visual Studio Code extensions—Live Server, Code Runner, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Microsoft Live Preview—that collectively have over 125 million installs. These flaws enable remote code execution and local file theft without user interaction, exploiting insecure API handling and insufficient sandboxing.\n\nParagraph 2: Developers and enterprises using these extensions face massive exposure: a single compromised extension enables lateral movement across entire codebases, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployments. Given VS Code’s centrality in modern software development, this represents a high-impact supply chain risk where attackers could inject backdoors into proprietary software or steal intellectual property at scale.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A hacker accessed data from 1.2 million French bank accounts by using stolen credentials of a government official to query a national banking database. The breach, confirmed by the French Economy Ministry on February 18, involved unauthorized access to sensitive data including account numbers, names, addresses, and in some cases, tax identification numbers. The attacker operated undetected from late January until discovery.\n\nParagraph 2: This incident exposes systemic weaknesses in credential hygiene and access controls across government-critical infrastructure partnerships. The compromise of financial data at national scale undermines public trust in banking security and highlights the growing threat of insider credential theft—especially as attackers increasingly target third-party access points rather than direct system breaches.",

      "summary": "Paragraph 1: Researchers demonstrated that AI assistants like Grok and Microsoft Copilot—when enabled with web browsing and URL-fetching features—can be weaponized as covert command-and-control (C2) channels. Malware can instruct these services to fetch payloads or exfiltrate data via natural-language queries, masking malicious traffic as legitimate AI interactions and evading traditional network detection.\n\nParagraph 2: This technique significantly complicates threat detection for enterprises relying on AI tools, as C2 traffic blends with routine user activity. It represents a new class of ‘stealth C2’ that leverages trusted cloud services, blurring the line between productivity tools and attack infrastructure and forcing a reevaluation of AI policy and network monitoring strategies.",

Attackers can exploit this flaw to take complete control of devices, intercept calls, deploy eavesdropping payloads, or pivot into internal enterprise networks via VoIP infrastructure.\n\nParagraph 2: With VoIP phones often connected directly to corporate LANs and lacking robust security controls, this vulnerability poses severe risk to enterprises using these devices for business communications. Given the widespread deployment of Grandstream phones in contact centers and enterprise environments, unpatched systems are highly vulnerable to exploitation—especially as PoCs emerge rapidly.",

The flaw enables attackers to hijack surveillance systems used in critical infrastructure, government facilities, and commercial sites without credentials.\n\nParagraph 2: Compromised CCTV systems can facilitate physical security breaches, surveillance evasion, and reconnaissance for future attacks. Given Honeywell’s presence in energy, transportation, and defense sectors, this vulnerability has high operational impact—especially as attackers increasingly target physical security infrastructure as an entry vector into broader IT/OT environments.",

Leaked files include retirement plan details, financial interests, internal meeting notes, and pipeline data—providing rich context for targeted fraud.\n\nParagraph 2: Ransomware group Shiny Hunters claimed responsibility and is now publishing stolen data after Betterment refused to pay the ransom. This incident underscores the growing threat of third-party supply chain breaches in financial services and the escalation of double-extortion tactics targeting sensitive financial intelligence beyond PII alone.",

It embeds itself during the boot process via Zygote injection, enabling ad fraud, credential theft, full remote control, and payload delivery—similar to the earlier Triada malware but with enhanced evasion and persistence capabilities.\n\nParagraph 2: Firmware-level infections are exceptionally difficult to remove, often requiring full device reflash or replacement. With Keenadu found across multiple device manufacturers and OTA update paths, this represents a widespread supply chain compromise threatening millions of users and raising concerns about OEM security vetting and mobile threat defense gaps.",

The flaw allows the AI assistant to process and summarize restricted content—including sensitive financial, legal, or healthcare data—that should be shielded under existing compliance frameworks.\n\nParagraph 2: This undermines core enterprise DLP strategies and exposes organizations to regulatory violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and data leakage. As Copilot adoption grows, such logic flaws in AI integration layers pose novel risks: even with proper policies in place, misconfigured or buggy AI components can silently exfiltrate or expose protected information.",
