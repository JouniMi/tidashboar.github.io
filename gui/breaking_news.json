      "date": "2026-02-13T15:19:09Z",
      "summary": "A critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2026-1731, CVSS 9.9) in BeyondTrust Remote Support and older Privileged Remote Access products was patched on February 6, 2026, but attackers began exploiting it within hours of a proof-of-concept exploit being published. The flaw enables unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands by sending specially crafted HTTP requests, allowing full system compromise without credentials.\n\nThis rapid exploitation—observed globally by multiple threat intelligence firms—demonstrates how quickly high-impact flaws in privileged access management tools are weaponized. Organizations using BeyondTrust RS or legacy PRA products remain at extreme risk unless patched immediately, as the vulnerability directly undermines the security model of privileged session management systems used across critical infrastructure and enterprise environments.",

      "date": "2026-02-12T14:01:13Z",
      "summary": "Apple released emergency security updates fixing a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2026-20700) in the Dynamic Link Editor (dyld) component affecting iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS. The flaw—a memory corruption issue—was actively exploited in targeted attacks against specific individuals, with Google’s Threat Analysis Group (GTIG) credited with its discovery. Exploitation enables arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing full device compromise and spyware deployment.\n\nThis marks Apple’s first actively exploited zero-day of 2026 and underscores the growing use of zero-day exploits in nation-state or advanced spyware campaigns. The involvement of Google GTIG suggests coordination between major tech vendors in detecting and mitigating high-end threats, with implications for high-value targets including journalists, activists, and government personnel.",

      "summary": "The North Korean APT Lazarus Group launched a supply chain campaign—codenamed graphalgo—targeting JavaScript and Python developers by publishing malicious packages to npm and PyPI under the guise of fake job recruitment. The campaign, active since May 2025, uses cryptocurrency-themed coding challenges to lure victims into downloading compromised packages that deploy backdoors and credential stealers, enabling persistent access to developer environments and corporate networks.\n\nThis attack highlights the increasing sophistication of supply chain compromises targeting developer tooling, where trust in open-source ecosystems is weaponized. Developers and organizations using public package registries are at elevated risk, especially those in fintech and crypto sectors, as compromised developer machines often serve as launchpads for broader enterprise breaches.",

Notably, CVE-2024-43468—patched in October 2024—is now being actively exploited, while CVE-2025-15556 in Notepad++ enables code execution via malicious Markdown links.\n\nThe inclusion of these flaws in the KEV catalog signals urgent risk to federal agencies and critical infrastructure, especially given Notepad++’s widespread use in enterprise environments. Attackers are leveraging trusted tools like Notepad++ to bypass security controls, illustrating a trend of infrastructure abuse for initial access and lateral movement.",

      "summary": "Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) reported that APT groups from North Korea (UNC2970), China (APT31), Iran, and Russia are actively using Google’s Gemini AI model for reconnaissance, phishing, and attack planning—without breaching the model itself. Tactics include model extraction attempts, AI-assisted crafting of culturally accurate phishing messages, and ‘rapport-building’ multi-step social engineering. APT31 reportedly used Gemini to auto-analyze vulnerabilities and plan attacks against U.S. organizations.\n\nThis represents a significant escalation in AI weaponization, where adversaries leverage public LLMs to amplify tradecraft rather than rely on zero-day exploits. The findings warn that even non-compromised AI systems pose strategic risks through misuse, forcing enterprises to reassess AI-related threat surfaces and invest in AI-aware detection and response capabilities.",

The breach did not impact My Odido account passwords, call logs, or billing data, but the breadth of PII exposed enables high-impact identity theft and credential stuffing campaigns.\n\nAs the Netherlands’ largest mobile network operator, Odido’s breach has national-scale implications, particularly given the inclusion of financial data.

      "summary": "Researchers uncovered over 30 malicious Google Chrome extensions—installed by more than 300,000 users—that masquerade as AI assistants to steal credentials, email content, and browsing history. These extensions, many still active in the Chrome Web Store, use remote iframe overlays to mimic legitimate interfaces and exfiltrate sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers. The campaign leverages AI hype to increase user trust and installation rates.\n\nThis supply chain abuse of the Chrome Web Store demonstrates how AI-themed lures are being weaponized to bypass user skepticism and security controls. Organizations relying on Chrome extensions for productivity or AI tools are at heightened risk, especially given the extensions’ ability to access browser-stored credentials and session tokens.",

Volvo Group North America confirmed 17,000 employees were affected, while Texas and Oregon saw 15 million and 10 million impacted respectively. The breach originated in a January 2025 attack and was disclosed in stages over multiple months.\n\nThe scale and delayed disclosure raise serious concerns about third-party risk management and incident response transparency. With Conduent serving major clients across healthcare, finance, and government sectors, the breach could trigger cascading regulatory investigations and class-action litigation, setting a precedent for enterprise liability in outsourced data breaches.",

VoidLink features a compile-on-demand architecture enabling on-the-fly tool generation and supports Windows implants with plugin-loading capabilities. The group has been active since at least 2019, though its current infrastructure suggests evolving capabilities aligned with AI-enabled attack frameworks.\n\nVoidLink’s modular design and adaptability represent a new generation of flexible, AI-augmented malware, where operators can rapidly tailor payloads to victim environments. This underscores a shift toward highly customizable, low-signature attack tools that evade traditional detection, posing significant challenges for endpoint security and threat hunting teams.",

The campaign uses social engineering to lure victims into downloading malicious packages or executing scripts under the pretense of technical assessments, often via LinkedIn or Telegram. This follows the group’s broader pattern of supply chain and developer-targeted attacks to gain initial access to high-value targets.\n\nBy focusing on developer communities and leveraging domain-specific lures (e.g., crypto projects), Lazarus increases the likelihood of successful compromise while reducing suspicion.
