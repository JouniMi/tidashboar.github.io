      "date": "2026-02-03T09:35:23Z",
      "summary": "State‑sponsored attackers compromised the hosting provider that serves Notepad++ updates, redirecting traffic to malicious servers that delivered a new backdoor dubbed Chrysalis. The intrusion was an infrastructure‑level breach, not a flaw in the Notepad++ code, and it persisted for months before the update mechanism was hardened.\n\nMillions of developers who install Notepad++ on Windows and Linux received malicious updates that could execute arbitrary code, exposing source code and credentials. The campaign has been linked to the China‑linked Lotus Blossom (also known as apt41) group, raising serious supply‑chain concerns for widely used developer tools.",

      "summary": "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) verified that ransomware gangs are exploiting CVE‑2025‑22225, an arbitrary‑write vulnerability in VMware ESXi that enables a VM‑escape to the host kernel. The flaw was patched by Broadcom in March 2025, but attackers are still leveraging it to gain full control of hypervisors.\n\nEnterprises running ESXi, including many Fortune 500 companies and cloud service providers, face ransomware encryption of virtual machines and potential data exfiltration. The rapid weaponization of this zero‑day underscores the critical risk of unpatched virtualization infrastructure.",

Exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected servers.\n\nU.S. federal agencies and private enterprises that rely on SolarWinds WHD have been ordered to patch immediately, as the bug can lead to full system compromise and lateral movement. The rapid emergence of an exploit for a freshly patched bug highlights the high‑risk nature of supply‑chain software used across critical infrastructure.",

The zero‑day allows remote code execution on victim machines before the patch is applied.\n\nThe campaign targeted government agencies in Ukraine, Slovakia and Romania, compromising sensitive communications and internal networks.

Attackers have been sending crafted POST requests to compromised development environments, dropping Rust‑based malware before the vulnerability was publicly disclosed.\n\nCompanies and developers that build mobile apps with React Native are at risk of supply‑chain compromise, as malicious payloads can be injected into build pipelines and ultimately reach end‑users.

The exploit chain combined exposed IAM credentials with automated privilege‑escalation scripts generated by large language models.\n\nThe incident highlights the emerging risk of AI‑augmented attacks against cloud infrastructures, threatening any enterprise that relies on AWS for critical workloads. Misconfigured IAM policies and exposed access keys can enable rapid, stealthy takeovers, prompting urgent review of cloud security hygiene.",
