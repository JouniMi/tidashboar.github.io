      "date": "2026-02-23T11:41:47Z",
      "summary": "Paragraph 1: A Russian-speaking cybercriminal leveraged commercial generative AI tools to compromise over 600 internet-exposed FortiGate firewalls across 55 countries between January 11 and February 18, 2026. According to Amazon Threat Intelligence, the attacker did not exploit any FortiGate vulnerabilities; instead, they abused exposed management ports and weak single-factor credentials, using AI to automate credential stuffing, reconnaissance, and lateral movement.\n\nParagraph 2: This campaign marks a significant escalation in AI-augmented cybercrime, demonstrating how off-the-shelf AI services can dramatically scale infrastructure compromise without requiring zero-day exploits. The widespread nature of the breach—spanning critical infrastructure, enterprises, and service providers—heightens risks of secondary attacks, data exfiltration, and firewall reconfiguration for persistent access.",

CISA and multiple vendors confirmed attackers are using the flaw to deploy VShell, establish persistence, move laterally, and facilitate ransomware deployment—including deploying web shells and backdoors to maintain long-term access.\n\nParagraph 2: The vulnerability, patched on February 6, 2026, remains unpatched across many enterprise environments, making it a high-priority target for ransomware groups. Its exploitation in active ransomware campaigns significantly increases risk for organizations relying on BeyondTrust for privileged access management, especially in healthcare, finance, and government sectors.",

The campaign deploys novel malware families including GhostFetch, CHAR, and HTTP_VIP—used for credential harvesting, command-and-control tunneling, and persistence—via spearphishing and compromised websites.\n\nParagraph 2: This activity reflects MuddyWater’s evolving tradecraft and strategic focus on intelligence gathering from government, telecom, energy, and media sectors. The use of newly developed, less-detectable malware underscores the group’s growing sophistication and the persistent threat posed by nation-state actors targeting critical regional infrastructure.",

Users downloading the malicious NSIS installer received ValleyRAT—a sophisticated RAT built on the Winos4.0 framework—equipped with advanced stealth and injection capabilities to steal credentials, Wi-Fi keys, and maintain persistence.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain impersonation attack specifically targets security-conscious users in mainland China, exploiting trust in a widely used domestic antivirus product. The campaign highlights how APTs increasingly abuse software reputation and localization to bypass user skepticism and evade detection, posing serious risks to individual and enterprise systems across Asia.",

CVE-2025-49113 is a deserialization flaw that went unnoticed for over a decade and enables remote code execution; CVE-2025-68461 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploited via SVG animate tags.\n\nParagraph 2: RoundCube is widely used in government and enterprise email environments, and past exploitation by APT28 and Winter Vivern confirms its high-value status. The KEV designation mandates urgent patching by U.S. federal agencies and signals elevated risk for all organizations still running unpatched versions, especially those with exposed webmail interfaces.",

The malicious update silently installed OpenClaw on developer systems, leveraging the tool’s legitimate access to code repositories and build environments to exfiltrate credentials and CI/CD secrets.\n\nParagraph 2: This supply chain attack demonstrates how open-source AI tools can become high-impact attack vectors, especially when integrated into developer workflows. With over 4,000 unintended installs reported, the compromise poses significant risk to software integrity, intellectual property, and CI/CD pipelines across startups and enterprises relying on AI-assisted coding tools.",

The malware leverages Gemini to analyze on-screen content and ensure it remains pinned in the recent apps list—even after reboot—enabling covert surveillance including lockscreen data capture, screenshots, screen recording, and uninstallation resistance.\n\nParagraph 2: This marks a new era of AI-assisted mobile threats where malware uses generative AI not for initial infection but for adaptive, long-term persistence. Given Gemini’s integration into Android 15+ devices, PromptSpy could achieve broad reach, threatening consumer privacy and enterprise data on BYOD devices, especially in high-value sectors like finance and government.",

Unlike static phishing kits, Starkiller loads the actual target site and relays interactions, making it extremely difficult to detect via URL or visual inspection—effectively bypassing MFA and browser-based protections.\n\nParagraph 2: This service significantly lowers the barrier for credential theft campaigns, enabling less-skilled actors to conduct highly effective attacks against major platforms. Its ability to defeat modern authentication controls elevates the threat landscape, particularly for organizations relying solely on MFA without additional behavioral or device-based verification.",
