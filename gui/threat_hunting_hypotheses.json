      "description": "Attackers have evolved the ClickFix technique to abuse nslookup for DNS-based malware staging. Instead of relying on PowerShell or mshta (now commonly blocked), threat actors trick users into running nslookup commands that query custom DNS domains to retrieve encoded payloads. This method leverages legitimate Windows tools and blends into normal DNS traffic, making it harder to detect.",
