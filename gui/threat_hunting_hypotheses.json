Based on recent incidents, attackers likely gain initial access via supply chain compromise, phishing, or exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities (e.g., BeyondTrust CVE-2026-1731). We should hunt for Medusa-specific artifacts, lateral movement via legitimate remote access tools, and ransomware execution patterns.",
