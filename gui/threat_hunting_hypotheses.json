      "description": "Based on confirmed intrusions by China-linked APT UNC2814 (observed 5+ times in 14-day intel), this group uses Google Sheets as a covert C2 channel to communicate with compromised telecom and government targets. The group exfiltrates data and issues commands via Google Sheets API calls disguised as benign traffic. We hypothesize that similar C2 activity using Google Workspace services (Sheets, Docs) for command delivery and data exfiltration is active in environments lacking visibility into SaaS API behavior.",

This is a significant risk as AI-generated passwords are increasingly used in DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and autonomous systems. We hypothesize that such predictable passwords are present in enterprise environments, particularly in technology, cloud services, and DevOps sectors, creating easy targets for credential stuffing and dictionary attacks.",
