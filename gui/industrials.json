  "summary": "**Industrial‑Sector Threat Intelligence Report**  \n*Coverage window: 30 days – 30 Nov 2025 through 5 Jan 2026*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been marked by a **convergence of classic ransomware/APT activity, supply‑chain compromises, and a surge of publicly disclosed critical vulnerabilities** that are directly exploitable in industrial environments (OT, SCADA, manufacturing ERP, and critical‑infrastructure networks).  \n\n* **Ransomware pressure on energy & manufacturing** – The Oltenia Energy Complex (Romania) suffered a high‑impact ransomware intrusion, echoing a broader pattern of attacks on power‑generation and utility operators. A similar trend is visible in the **Everest ransomware leak of 1 TB of ASUS data**, underscoring that hardware‑OEMs and their downstream supply chains are now high‑value targets.  \n\n* **Supply‑chain and software‑component abuse** – The **Shai‑Hulud npm supply‑chain attack**, the **EmEditor download‑button malware**, and the **MongoBleed (CVE‑2025‑14847) MongoDB exposure** demonstrate that attackers are increasingly weaponising open‑source ecosystems and widely‑used development tools that industrial firms rely on for automation, data‑logging, and edge‑device management.  \n\n* **APT activity with kernel‑mode capabilities** – Chinese‑linked groups **Mustang Panda / HoneyMyte** have repeatedly deployed signed kernel‑mode rootkits (ToneShell) to gain persistent, low‑level access. While the public reports do not name a specific industrial victim, the technique is well‑suited to compromising OT gateways, PLC‑management stations, and industrial Windows servers.  \n\n* **Critical infrastructure reconnaissance & data‑theft** – A threat actor advertised “**critical‑utility files for sale**” (US utilities) and the **under‑sea cable sabotage** incident in Finland highlight a growing appetite for espionage‑grade disruption of the physical‑layer assets that underpin industrial production and logistics.  \n\n* **Vulnerability landscape** – The **CISA KEV catalog grew by ~20 % in 2025**, now listing >1,480 entries. Notable additions affecting industry include **MongoDB (CVE‑2025‑14847), IBM API Connect (critical auth‑bypass), Fortinet 2FA‑bypass, and SmarterMail RCE**. The rapid exploitation of these flaws (e.g., MongoBleed, React2Shell) demonstrates that threat actors are moving from “research” to “weaponisation” at unprecedented speed.  \n\n**Strategic implication:**  Industrial organisations must treat the cyber‑threat environment as a **blended risk** where ransomware, nation‑state APTs, and opportunistic supply‑chain actors all target the same attack surface—OT/IT convergence points, cloud‑based ERP/SCADA, and the software supply chain that powers automation.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Threat Actor / Group | Primary Tactics Observed | Industrial Relevance | Notable Campaigns (30‑day window) |\n|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Mustang Panda / HoneyMyte** (Chinese APT) | Signed kernel‑mode rootkits, ToneShell backdoor, DLL side‑loading, use of legitimate driver signing certificates | High – kernel‑level access can be leveraged against OT gateways, PLC engineering workstations, and industrial Windows servers. | “Mustang Panda deploys ToneShell via signed kernel‑mode rootkit driver” (30 Dec 2025) – multiple publications (SecurityAffairs, The Hacker News, SecurityWeek). |\n| **RondoDox Botnet** (IoT‑focused criminal botnet) | Exploits **React2Shell** (CVE‑2025‑xxxx) to hijack IoT/web servers; spreads miners & malware | Medium – many industrial edge devices run lightweight Linux/IoT stacks vulnerable to React2Shell. | “RondoDox Botnet Exploits Critical React2Shell Flaw to Hijack IoT Devices and Web Servers” (1 Jan 2026). |\n| **Shai‑Hulud** (Supply‑chain/cryptojacking group) | Compromises npm packages, injects malicious code into JavaScript libraries, targets crypto wallets and supply‑chain tooling. | Medium – npm is used for building custom SCADA dashboards, data‑ingestion pipelines, and CI/CD pipelines in manufacturing. | “Shai‑Hulud Supply Chain Attack Led to $8.5 Million Trust Wallet Heist” (31 Dec 2025). |\n| **Unnamed ransomware operators** (likely affiliate‑based) | Deploy ransomware encryptors, exfiltrate data, demand double‑extortion. | High – demonstrated by attack on **Oltenia Energy Complex** (29 Dec 2025) and **Everest ransomware on ASUS** (31 Dec 2025). |\n| **Utility‑data broker** (criminal market) | Harvests and sells configuration files, SCADA schematics, and network diagrams of US utilities. | High – direct threat to grid operators and downstream industrial customers. | “Cybercrook claims to be selling infrastructure info about three major US utilities” (2 Jan 2026). |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risks**  \n\n* **npm / open‑source libraries** – Shai‑Hulud’s npm compromise and the 27 malicious npm packages reported (31 Dec 2025) illustrate that a single compromised dependency can propagate to any industrial product that incorporates it (e.g., custom HMI web‑apps, data‑analytics pipelines).  \n\n* **Software download portals** – The **EmEditor homepage malware** (30 Dec 2025) shows that even reputable editor vendors can be leveraged to deliver infostealers to engineering workstations.  \n\n* **Enterprise ERP/CRM platforms** – The **Oracle EBS hack of Korean Air** (30 Dec 2025) underscores that ERP systems used for supply‑chain and asset‑management in manufacturing are attractive APT targets.  \n\n---\n\n## 3.
