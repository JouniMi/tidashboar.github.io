The most alarming development is the confirmed attempted wiper attack on Poland’s power grid, attributed to the Russia-linked Sandworm APT, using the newly identified **DynoWiper** malware. This incident marks a rare public, near-successful strike against a national power grid in recent years and signals a renewed willingness by advanced threat actors to pursue destructive capabilities in the OT environment.\n\nSimultaneously, a wave of opportunistic but highly effective attacks has exploited widespread vulnerabilities in enterprise infrastructure that *indirectly but critically* impact industrial operations: the **FortiGate FortiCloud SSO bypass** (affecting firewalls deployed across OT/IT boundary devices), the **SmarterMail auth bypass**, and the **CVE-2026-24061 (GNU InetUtils telnetd)** flaw—despite being an 11-year-old vulnerability, it remains actively exploited due to legacy system exposure in industrial environments. These attacks enable lateral movement into corporate IT networks, which often retain insecure connections to OT systems, thereby facilitating reconnaissance, credential theft, and potential disruption.\n\nCross-sector threats—especially SSO account compromise (led by **ShinyHunters**) and AI-augmented phishing (e.g., **Stanley** toolkit, AI-built PowerShell backdoors)—are increasingly weaponized against energy and manufacturing firms via SharePoint abuse, vishing kits, and multi-stage BEC campaigns. The convergence of IT/OT risk is no longer theoretical: attackers are exploiting the *integration points* between corporate and operational systems, with clear intent to disrupt physical processes.\n\nStrategic implications are severe:  \n- **Operational resilience is under direct threat** from destructive malware targeting critical infrastructure.  \n- **Legacy protocol exposure (e.g., Telnet)** remains a critical vulnerability across aging industrial control systems (ICS).  \n- **Supply chain compromises** (e.g., VS Code AI extensions, PyPI packages) now extend beyond software development to threaten the integrity of engineering tools used in industrial design and automation.\n\n---\n\n## **Threat Actor Intelligence**\n\n### **Key Actors Targeting Industrials**\n| Actor | Affiliation | Targeting Pattern | Notable Activity (Jan 2026) |\n|-------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------|\n| **Sandworm (APT28-linked)** | Russia (GRU) | Destructive attacks on critical infrastructure | Attempted wiper attack on Polish power grid using **DynoWiper**; linked to multiple ICS-targeted campaigns |\n| **ShinyHunters** | Cybercrime (likely affiliate-based) | Identity theft, credential harvesting, data exfiltration | Claimed compromise of Okta customers across multiple sectors—including energy firms; leaked 1.4TB of Nike data; breached Crunchbase, SoundCloud, Betterment |\n| **KONNI (Fancy Bear)** | Russia (SVR) | Targeted espionage, supply chain, AI-augmented malware | Deployed AI-generated PowerShell backdoor against blockchain engineers; used AI to build stealthy tooling |\n| **Scattered Spider / Crims** | U.S.-based cybercrime (affiliates of ALPHV/BlackCat) | Identity theft, vishing, helpdesk fraud | Compromised Microsoft accounts of energy firms; sold voice-phishing kits to enable SSO bypass via social engineering |\n\n### **Attack Patterns Specific to Industrials**\n- **OT-adjacent pivot attacks**: Attackers compromise IT systems (e.g., email, SSO, collaboration tools), then exploit insecure IT/OT gateways (e.g., unpatched ICS firewalls, legacy protocols) to reach OT networks.\n- **Wiper deployment in energy sector**: DynoWiper—designed to overwrite disk sectors and disable recovery—was used in an attempted attack on Poland’s power grid, indicating intent to cause physical disruption.\n- **Supply chain targeting of engineering tools**: Malicious VS Code extensions (1.5M installs) and PyPI packages impersonating legitimate libraries (e.g., SymPy) enable code theft and backdoor injection—threatening the integrity of industrial automation codebases.\n\n### **Supply Chain Risks**\n- **Developer tooling compromise**: Malicious VS Code AI extensions (Jan 23–26) and PyPI packages (Jan 22) directly threaten industrial R&D and automation software development.\n- **Cloud identity infrastructure**: FortiGate SSO bypass (Jan 22–23) and Okta compromises (ShinyHunters, Jan 23–26) enable attackers to impersonate legitimate users across cloud and on-prem environments—critical for accessing engineering workstations and SCADA servers.\n- **Legacy protocol exposure**: The CVE-2026-24061 telnetd flaw (11-year-old) remains actively exploited; nearly 800,000 Telnet servers exposed globally, many in industrial settings where Telnet persists due to legacy device constraints.\n\n---\n\n## **Technical Threat Analysis**\n\n### **Critical Vulnerabilities Affecting Industrials**\n| CVE | Product | Severity | Exploitation Status | Industrial Relevance |\n|-----|---------|----------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| **CVE-2026-24061** | GNU InetUtils telnetd | **Critical (10.0)** | Actively exploited | High: Telnet remains in use on legacy PLCs, HMIs, and SCADA servers; enables root access for lateral movement |\n| **CVE-2026-20045** | Cisco Unified CM | Critical | Actively exploited; in CISA KEV | High: Unified CM integrates with VoIP systems used in industrial plants; exploitation enables eavesdropping, call hijacking, and network pivoting |\n| **FortiGate FortiCloud SSO Bypass** | Fortinet FortiGate | Critical | Actively exploited; affects *fully patched* devices | Critical: Firewalls are primary OT/IT boundary devices; config theft enables traffic interception, DNS hijacking, and OT network reconfiguration |\n| **SmarterMail Auth Bypass** | SmarterMail | Critical | Actively exploited (multiple flaws) | Medium-High: Used by many mid-sized utilities and manufacturers for internal comms; admin account compromise enables lateral movement |\n\n### **Malware Families & Techniques**\n- **DynoWiper**: New wiper targeting Polish power grid; designed to overwrite disk sectors and disable recovery mechanisms. Uses custom driver for persistence. *Industrials relevance: High—direct OT disruption capability.*\n- **Osiris Ransomware**: Emerged Jan 22; leverages **BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver)** to disable security tools. *Relevance: Threatens endpoint security on engineering workstations and HMI/SCADA hosts.*\n- **Stanley Toolkit**: $6,000 phishing kit sold on Russian forums; spoofs secure URLs in Chrome to steal credentials. *Relevance: Enables initial access to corporate portals used by industrial employees.*\n- **Amatera Stealer**: Deployed via fake CAPTCHA scams using Microsoft tools. *Relevance: Targets employee credentials for access to cloud-based engineering platforms (e.g., AWS IoT, Azure OT integrations).*\n\n### **Attack Vectors & Surface**\n- **SSO/Identity Layer**: FortiCloud SSO bypass and Okta compromises enable attackers to bypass MFA and gain persistent access to cloud and on-prem resources.\n- **Email & Collaboration Tools**: SharePoint abuse in phishing campaigns (energy sector), SmarterMail exploits, and Teams billing phishing indicate email remains the primary initial access vector.\n- **Legacy Protocol Exposure**: Telnet (CVE-2026-24061) remains a high-risk vector due to widespread use in older industrial devices with no patch available.\n- **Developer Tooling**: VS Code extensions and PyPI packages demonstrate that supply chain attacks now target the *design and development phase* of industrial software—potentially embedding backdoors in automation logic.\n\n---\n\n## **Strategic Intelligence**\n\n### **Sub-Sector Risk Assessment**\n| Sub-Sector | Risk Level | Key Threats | Incident Examples |\n|------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **Energy (Electric, Oil & Gas)** | ⚠️ **CRITICAL** | Wiper attacks, SSO compromise, SharePoint phishing, legacy protocol abuse | Polish power grid wiper attempt (Sandworm); energy firms targeted in multi-stage phishing/BEC campaigns using SharePoint |\n| **Manufacturing** | ⚠️ **HIGH** | Engineering tool compromise (VS Code, PyPI), ransomware, IT/OT lateral movement | Malicious VS Code extensions (1.5M installs); Osiris ransomware targeting engineering workstations |\n| **Utilities (Water, Waste)** | ⚠️ **HIGH** | Legacy protocol exposure (Telnet), firewall misconfigurations, credential theft | CVE-2026-24061 exploitation; FortiGate SSO bypass affecting perimeter security |\n| **Transportation & Logistics** | ⚠️ **MODERATE-HIGH** | Automotive zero-days (Pwn2Own), supply chain attacks | Pwn2Own Automotive 2026: 76 zero-days discovered; infotainment/EV charger exploits |\n\n### **High-Impact Security Incidents**\n1. **Polish Power Grid Wiper Attack (Jan 24–26)**  \n   - **Actor**: Sandworm  \n   - **Tool**: DynoWiper  \n   - **Impact**: Attempted destruction of grid control systems; prevented by security controls.  \n   - **Lesson**: Destructive malware is now operational in critical infrastructure; air-gapped systems are insufficient without network segmentation and integrity monitoring.\n\n2. **FortiGate SSO Bypass Campaign (Jan 22–23)**  \n   - **Actor**: Unknown (attributed to multiple threat actors via ShinyHunters)  \n   - **Impact**: Firewall configuration theft, potential OT network reconfiguration  \n   - **Lesson**: Even fully patched devices are vulnerable; continuous configuration monitoring and network segmentation are essential.\n\n3. **ShinyHunters Okta SSO Campaign (Jan 23–26)**  \n   - **Impact**: Compromised SSO accounts across energy, manufacturing, and logistics firms  \n   - **Lesson**: SSO is now the #1 attack surface; enforce strict access controls, session validation, and real-time anomaly detection.\n\n### **Incident Response Insights**\n- **Legacy systems require active mitigation**: Telnet exposure cannot be patched—organizations must isolate telnet-enabled devices, restrict access via firewall rules, and deploy network detection (e.g., Zeek, Suricata rules for telnet anomalies).\n- **SSO compromise demands rapid credential rotation**: ShinyHunters’ Okta campaign shows attackers move within hours; IR plans must include immediate SSO session revocation and MFA reset.\n- **Wiper detection requires behavioral monitoring**: DynoWiper bypassed traditional AV; organizations need OT-specific endpoint detection (e.g., Claroty, Dragos) and disk integrity monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## **Forward-Looking Assessment**\n\n### **Emerging Threat Trends**\n1. **AI-Augmented OT Attacks**: KONNI’s AI-built PowerShell backdoor and Stanley’s phishing toolkit indicate attackers are automating reconnaissance, credential harvesting, and evasion—making attacks faster and harder to detect.\n2. **Destructive Malware Escalation**: DynoWiper suggests a shift from ransomware to wipers in nation-state targeting of critical infrastructure; expect similar tools against water, gas, and transportation systems.\n3. **Supply Chain Weaponization of Engineering Tools**: VS Code extensions and PyPI impersonation show attackers are targeting the *design phase* of industrial software—threatening the integrity of PLC/SCADA code before deployment.\n4. **Legacy Protocol Exploitation**: With 800,000+ Telnet servers exposed, CVE-2026-24061 will remain a high-impact vector until legacy devices are retired or isolated.\n\n### **Recommended Defensive Priorities**\n| Priority | Action | Rationale |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| **1. OT/IT Boundary Hardening** | Audit firewall rules, disable Telnet/FTP on all OT-facing devices, enforce micro-segmentation | FortiGate SSO bypass and telnet exploits target boundary devices; segmentation limits lateral movement |\n| **2. SSO & Identity Governance** | Implement zero-trust access, enforce strict MFA (FIDO2), monitor for anomalous SSO logins | ShinyHunters and FortiCloud attacks exploit identity infrastructure; SSO is the #1 pivot point |\n| **3. Engineering Tool Integrity** | Scan VS Code/PyPI extensions for malicious code; use code-signing and isolated development environments | Malicious extensions compromise automation logic; integrity is critical for safe operation |\n| **4. Legacy Protocol Mitigation** | Deploy network detection for Telnet/FTP; isolate legacy devices; prioritize device replacement | CVE-2026-24061 is unpatchable; mitigation is the only option for aging infrastructure |\n| **5. Wiper Detection & Response** | Deploy OT-specific EDR (e.g., Claroty, Nozomi), implement disk integrity monitoring, conduct tabletop exercises for destructive incidents | DynoWiper proves wipers are operational; early detection is the last line of defense |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The Industrials sector is entering a new phase of cyber conflict, where nation-state actors and sophisticated cybercrime groups are actively testing destructive capabilities against critical infrastructure. The attempted wiper attack on Poland’s power grid is a watershed moment—confirming that cyber operations can now directly threaten physical safety and national security. Immediate action on identity security, OT/IT boundary hardening, and legacy protocol remediation is non-negotiable. Organizations must treat cyber resilience as inseparable from operational resilience.\n\n*— End of Report —*  \n**Distribution**: CISA, ICS-CERT, Sector Coordinating Councils (Energy, Water), Critical Infrastructure Owners & Operators  \n**Next Update**: 5 February 2026 (Post-PwC/ICS Security Summit Analysis)",
