  "summary": "**COMMUNICATION SERVICES – THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT**  \n*Coverage window: 30 days (30 Nov 2025 – 6 Jan 2026)*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe Communication Services sector (telecom operators, broadband ISPs, satellite & under‑sea cable providers, broadcast & streaming platforms, and internet‑based collaboration tools) faced a **confluence of supply‑chain, software‑vulnerability, and nation‑state espionage threats** during the last month.  \n\n* **Software‑exposure spikes** – two high‑severity vulnerabilities that are widely used in the sector were disclosed: the **SmarterMail remote‑code‑execution flaw (CVSS 9.8)** and the **MongoDB “MongoBleed” flaw (CVE‑2025‑14847, CVSS 9.2)**. Both are actively exploited in the wild and affect email‑gateway appliances, hosted mail services, and any back‑office data‑stores that telecoms and streaming platforms rely on.  \n\n* **Targeted espionage campaigns** – Russian‑linked APT UAC‑0184 leveraged the **Viber messaging app** to spy on Ukrainian military communications, while a separate campaign harvested **WhatsApp metadata**. Both apps are embedded in many consumer‑facing communication services and corporate collaboration suites, raising the risk of credential‑theft and traffic‑analysis attacks.  \n\n* **Infrastructure‑focused incidents** – a **femtocell security failure at a Korean telco**, a **physical under‑sea cable sabotage in the Baltic Sea**, and **multiple breach reports from the U.S. broadband provider Brightspeed** illustrate that attackers are probing both the logical and physical layers of the network.  \n\n* **Supply‑chain & extension abuse** – the **Zoom‑Stealer browser‑extension** and **malicious VS Code/VS Code‑like extensions** demonstrate that the “extension marketplace” attack vector is now a preferred route for stealing meeting credentials and injecting malicious code into collaboration tools.  \n\nOverall, the sector’s attack surface is expanding from traditional network‑perimeter exploits to **cloud‑native APIs, third‑party extensions, and the underlying communications infrastructure**. The convergence of high‑severity CVEs, nation‑state espionage, and supply‑chain abuse creates a **high‑risk environment** for any organization that hosts email, video‑conferencing, or broadband services.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
