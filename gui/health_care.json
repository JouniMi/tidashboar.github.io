  "summary": "**THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT – HEALTHCARE SECTOR**  \n*Coverage period: 30 days (1 Jan – 11 Jan 2026)*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been marked by a **convergence of three dominant trends** that are reshaping the risk landscape for healthcare organisations:\n\n| Trend | What we saw in the data | Why it matters to health‑care |\n|-------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **AI‑driven health services under scrutiny** | Two OpenAI announcements (ChatGPT Health launch – 06 Jan; policy that health data will not be used for model training – 23 Jan) and a “Are we ready for ChatGPT Health?” analysis (09 Jan). | Health‑tech vendors are rapidly deploying LLM‑based patient‑facing tools. The novelty of the data‑handling model creates regulatory exposure (HIPAA, GDPR) and a new attack surface for data‑exfiltration or model‑poisoning. |\n| **Exploitation of legacy/third‑party infrastructure** | Active exploitation of **D‑Link DSL routers**, **Microsoft Office/PowerPoint**, **HPE OneView**, **Veeam Backup**, **n8n automation**, **Cisco ISE**, **Trend Micro Apex Central**, and **VMware ESXi** (multiple articles). | Hospitals and health‑systems still run legacy networking gear, on‑prem backup appliances, and generic SaaS automation platforms. Successful RCE chains in any of these components give attackers footholds to pivot to PHI stores, EHRs, and medical‑device networks. |\n| **Medical‑device and health‑data supply‑chain attacks** | Remote‑code execution demonstration on **WHILL powered‑wheelchairs** (08 Jan); NodeCordRAT hidden in npm packages (08 Jan); ransomware‑as‑service growth (08 Jan “Ransomware attacks kept climbing in 2025”). | The convergence of IoT‑medical devices, open‑source software, and ransomware‑as‑a‑service dramatically raises the probability of a “device‑first” breach that can disrupt patient care and expose large volumes of PHI. |\n\n**Strategic implication:**  Healthcare organisations must treat AI health platforms, legacy IT assets, and medical‑device supply chains as a single, inter‑connected attack surface. Failure to patch, to enforce zero‑trust controls, or to vet third‑party AI services will likely result in data‑loss, service disruption, and regulatory penalties.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Group | Target(s) in Healthcare | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) | Notable 2026 Activity |\n|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Chinese‑linked APT groups (UAT‑7290, “China‑linked”)** | Telecoms, but also *critical infrastructure* that includes hospital networks (e.g., edge‑device exploits) | Modular malware, supply‑chain implants, lateral movement via compromised routers | Exploited edge devices (08 Jan) – same hardware families (D‑Link) also seen in generic attacks on health sites. |\n| **North Korean APT Kimsuky** | Government & health agencies (phishing via QR codes) | QR‑code “quishing” (QR‑based phishing), credential harvesting | FBI warning (09 Jan) – QR‑code phishing campaigns have been observed targeting health‑service portals. |\n| **MuddyWater** | Middle‑East health providers (via RustyWater RAT) | Spear‑phishing with malicious attachments, RAT deployment | Launch of RustyWater RAT (10 Jan) – RATs are frequently repurposed for exfiltrating PHI. |\n| **Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS) gangs** | Hospitals, health‑tech SaaS, medical‑device manufacturers | Double‑extortion, encryption of backups, targeting of Veeam/backup appliances | “Ransomware attacks kept climbing in 2025” (08 Jan) – Veeam vulnerabilities (multiple CVEs) are a prime vector. |\n| **Open‑source supply‑chain actors** (NodeCordRAT, n8n exploit) | Any health organisation using npm packages or low‑code automation (e.g., workflow orchestration) | Malicious npm modules, unauthenticated RCE in n8n (CVSS 10.0) | NodeCordRAT hidden in Bitcoin‑themed npm packages (08 Jan); n8n “Ni8mare” flaw (multiple 01‑08 Jan articles). |\n| **Opportunistic “medical‑device” researchers** (academic/independent) | Manufacturers of assistive devices (WHILL wheelchair) | Remote exploitation of Bluetooth/Wi‑Fi interfaces, firmware tampering | Remote hacking of WHILL wheelchair demonstrated (08 Jan). |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risks** – The convergence of compromised npm packages, vulnerable automation platforms (n8n), and unpatched backup solutions (Veeam) creates a *chain of trust* that health organisations often overlook. An exploit in a generic SaaS tool can cascade into a breach of protected health information (PHI).\n\n---\n\n## 3.
