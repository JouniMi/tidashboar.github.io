  "summary": "**THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT – HEALTHCARE SECTOR**  \n*Coverage window: 30 days (1 Jan – 31 Jan 2026)*  \n\nPrepared by: **Cyber‑Security Analyst – Healthcare Specialty**  \nDate: 7 Feb 2026  \n\n---  \n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been marked by a **convergence of three high‑impact trends** that shape the risk landscape for hospitals, health‑systems, medical‑device manufacturers, and health‑tech SaaS providers:\n\n| Trend | What we observed | Why it matters to healthcare |\n|-------|------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Active exploitation of widely‑deployed enterprise components** (HPE OneView, Microsoft Office/PowerPoint, Cisco ISE, VMware ESXi, Trend Micro Apex Central, n8n automation) | Multiple CISA alerts and vendor‑issued emergency patches; proof‑of‑concept exploits released in the public domain. | Health‑care organisations run legacy on‑prem infrastructure (e.g., HPE servers, Cisco networking, VMware virtualization) and rely on Office for clinical documentation. A successful exploit can give attackers **lateral movement** into EMR/EHR systems, ransomware deployment, or exfiltration of PHI. |\n| **Targeted attacks on health‑data assets and medical devices** | • WHILL wheelchair remote‑code execution (researchers)  <br>• Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) breach affecting 700 k individuals  <br>• University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center patient‑record breach  <br>• California law banning health‑data brokerage | Demonstrates that **both traditional IT and OT/IoT** (assistive devices) are now in the adversary’s scope. The breach of a state‑run human‑services agency shows that **public‑sector health data** remains a high‑value, low‑defence target. |\n| **Rapid adoption of AI‑driven health products with immature security controls** | • OpenAI *ChatGPT Health* (isolated, encrypted health‑data controls)  <br>• Anthropic *Claude for Healthcare* (HIPAA‑ready)  <br>• Prompt‑injection and “bandaid” fixes reported for OpenAI models | AI‑enabled clinical decision support, patient‑portal chatbots, and health‑record analytics are being deployed faster than security‑by‑design processes can mature. Threats include **prompt‑injection, data leakage, model‑poisoning, and credential harvesting** from mis‑configured API endpoints. |\n\n**Strategic implications**  \n\n* **Supply‑chain exposure** – The same CVEs that affect generic enterprise software are being weaponised against health‑care networks, amplifying the impact of any unpatched system.  \n* **Regulatory pressure** – California’s ban on health‑data brokers and the IDHS breach highlight a tightening enforcement environment; non‑compliance will attract fines and reputational damage.  \n* **Ransomware resurgence** – 2025 ransomware counts remain high; health‑care continues to be a top‑value target because of the “patient‑care” urgency that pressures organisations to pay.  \n\n---  \n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Group | Primary Motivation | Healthcare‑Specific Activity (Jan 2026) | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) |\n|---------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **MuddyWater** (Iran‑linked) | Espionage, credential theft | “RustyWater” RAT campaign across Middle‑East sectors – includes health‑care providers in the region (article 2026‑01‑10). | Spear‑phishing with malicious attachments, PowerShell‑based RAT, credential dumping. |\n| **Kimsuky** (North‑Korea) | Political espionage, data collection | QR‑code spear‑phishing targeting U.S. organisations, including health‑care entities (article 2026‑01‑22). | QR‑code payloads delivering malicious Office macros, credential harvesting. |\n| **APT28 (Fancy Bear)** (Russia) | Strategic intelligence, credential theft | Credential‑stealing campaign that hit energy, policy, and **health‑care** organisations (article 2026‑01‑28). | Use of “Spearphishing Attachment”, credential‑stealing malware (e.g., TrickBot), lateral movement via Pass‑the‑Hash. |\n| **China‑linked “UAT‑7290”** | State‑sponsored espionage | Modular malware targeting telecoms but also **health‑care networks** that rely on telecom infrastructure (article 2026‑01‑14). | Exploits of Linux edge devices, custom C2, persistence via systemd. |\n| **Black Axe** (West‑African organized crime) | Financial fraud, ransomware | Arrests in Spain (article 2026‑01‑10) – members previously linked to ransomware campaigns that have hit hospitals. | Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS), double‑extortion, use of Cobalt Strike. |\n| **Generic cyber‑crime “Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service”** | Financial gain | Overall ransomware activity still climbing (article 2026‑01‑14). Health‑care remains a top‑value sector due to patient‑care urgency. | Exploit‑based initial access (e.g., CVE‑2025‑XXXX), encryption of EHR databases, ransom note with data‑leak threat. |\n| **Supply‑chain / Open‑source contributors** | Opportunistic exploitation | “NodeCordRAT” hidden in npm Bitcoin‑themed packages (article 2026‑01‑08) – could be pulled into health‑tech CI/CD pipelines. | Malicious npm modules, credential theft from developer machines, supply‑chain compromise. |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risks**  \n\n* **HPE OneView** – Actively exploited (CISA alerts 2026‑01‑08/10). Many health‑care data‑centers use HPE servers for imaging archives.  \n* **Microsoft Office PowerPoint/Office** – Legacy macros still present in clinical presentation decks; active exploitation reported.  \n* **Cisco ISE** – Identity‑service flaw with public PoC (article 2026‑01‑08). Health‑care networks use ISE for NAC; compromise can give attackers network‑wide credentials.  \n* **VMware ESXi** – Zero‑day exploits used by Chinese‑linked actors (articles 2026‑01‑09/10). Hospitals running private clouds are exposed.  \n\n---  \n\n## 3.
