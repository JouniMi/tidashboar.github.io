  "summary": "**Healthcare‑Focused Cyber Threat Intelligence Report**  \n*Coverage window: 30 days – 18 Dec 2025 through 22 Dec 2025*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been marked by a **convergence of supply‑chain vulnerabilities, ransomware activity, and credential‑focused campaigns** that directly impact the healthcare ecosystem. Two high‑profile data‑breach incidents – the **Virginia Mental Health Authority (VA‑MHA)** exposure of 113 k patient records and a **cyber‑intrusion of an NHS‑affiliated technology supplier** – illustrate that both public‑sector health providers and their third‑party vendors remain prime targets for opportunistic and state‑aligned actors.  \n\nAcross the broader attack surface, **multiple “known‑exploited” vulnerabilities (KEVs)** in networking and management stacks (Cisco AsyncOS, SonicWall SMA, WatchGuard Firebox, HPE OneView, ASUS Live Update) have been actively weaponised. Healthcare organisations, which heavily rely on these products for remote access, imaging, and IoT device management, are therefore exposed to **cross‑industry lateral‑movement campaigns**. Ransomware families such as **CL0P, Nefilim, and RansomHouse** continue to weaponise new encryption layers and target file‑sharing platforms (e.g., Gladinet CentreStack) that are common in hospital and clinic environments.  \n\n**Strategic implications:**  \n* Credential‑theft and phishing (OAuth, password‑spraying, WhatsApp “GhostPairing”) are the primary initial‑access vectors, often leveraged to gain footholds on privileged accounts used for EMR/EHR systems.  \n* Supply‑chain weaknesses in network appliances and management consoles provide a **low‑effort, high‑impact** path to compromise large health networks.  \n* Regulatory pressure (NIS2, HIPAA, state privacy laws) is intensifying, and the **Virginia breach** demonstrates how quickly PHI exposure can trigger enforcement actions and reputational damage.  \n\nHealthcare organisations must therefore prioritize **patch management of KEVs, hardened remote‑access architectures, and robust credential‑security controls** while maintaining incident‑response readiness for ransomware and data‑exfiltration events.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Group | Known Motive / Targeting | Healthcare‑Specific Activity (30‑day window) | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) |\n|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Kimsuky (North‑Korean APT)** | Espionage, credential harvesting, especially against government & health sectors in the Korean peninsula. | Spread of **DocSwap Android malware** via QR‑phishing (delivery‑app disguise). While the campaign is not explicitly aimed at U.S. health entities, the malware’s ability to exfiltrate documents makes it a credible threat to mobile health‑record (mHealth) apps. | QR‑phishing → Android droppers → Document‑stealing modules → C2 over HTTPS. |\n| **China‑aligned APT (UAT‑9686)** | Targeting of Cisco Secure Email Gateway & Secure Email/Web Manager. | No direct health‑sector victim reported, but many hospitals use Cisco Secure Email for PHI‑protected communications. | Exploitation of CVE‑2025‑xxxx in Cisco Email appliances → Credential dumping → Email‑based data exfiltration. |\n| **Iranian “Infy” APT** | Re‑emergence after years of silence; historically targets telecom & critical infrastructure. | No explicit health target in the data set, but the group’s renewed activity raises the risk of **targeted espionage against health‑research institutions**. | Use of custom RATs, multi‑stage payloads, and supply‑chain compromise of third‑party software. |\n| **Lazarus Group (North‑Korea)** | Financial theft, ransomware‑as‑a‑service, and espionage. | Embedded **BeaverTail** variant in developer tools – could be leveraged to compromise health‑tech development pipelines. | Supply‑chain injection → Code‑signing abuse → Persistence via scheduled tasks. |\n| **Ransomware Gangs (CL0P, Nefilim, RansomHouse)** | Monetisation of health‑sector data; hospitals are high‑value due to critical operations and willingness to pay. | • CL0P targeted **Gladinet CentreStack** (file‑share platform used by some health organisations). <br>• Nefilim affiliates pleaded guilty (US) – health‑sector victims are common in their historical activity. <br>• RansomHouse upgraded encryption, increasing de‑cryption complexity for victims. | Exploit of unpatched SMB/SMB‑v2, credential‑theft, double‑extortion (data leak + encryption). |\n| **Cyber‑criminal Phishing Campaigns (GhostPairing, OAuth‑phishing, RaccoonO365/0365)** | Credential harvesting for SaaS (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace) used by health providers. | • **GhostPairing** abuses WhatsApp device‑linking to hijack accounts – can be used to compromise staff communications. <br>• **OAuth‑phishing** targeting Microsoft 365 accounts – directly relevant to Office 365/EHR integrations. | Social engineering → Malicious QR/Link → OAuth token capture → Lateral movement via compromised admin accounts. |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risks**  \n- **Cisco AsyncOS, SonicWall SMA 1000, WatchGuard Firebox, HPE OneView, ASUS Live Update** – all listed in the U.S. CISA **Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog** during the period. Healthcare networks that have not yet patched these appliances are exposed to **active exploitation** (e.g., remote code execution, credential theft).  \n- **Third‑party SaaS platforms** (e.g., Gladinet CentreStack, Docker images) are being targeted for **malicious code injection** (e.g., CL0P’s supply‑chain compromise of container images).  \n\n---\n\n## 3.
