  "summary": "**THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT – HEALTHCARE SECTOR**  \n*Prepared 26 January 2026 – covering the 30‑day window 28 Dec 2025 → 27 Jan 2026*  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been dominated by **ransomware** and **supply‑chain** activity that directly impacted two high‑profile health‑care entities – **Covenant Health** (U.S. hospital network) and **Aflac** (U.S. health‑insurance carrier).  Both incidents involved the exfiltration of protected health information (PHI) for more than **475 k** and **22 M** individuals respectively, underscoring the sector’s continued exposure to large‑scale data‑theft and service‑disruption attacks.\n\nA secondary, but equally important, trend is the **widespread exploitation of the MongoDB “Heartbleed‑of‑MongoDB” (CVE‑2025‑14847) and the newer unauthenticated memory‑read flaw (CVE‑2025‑14847‑2)**.  Healthcare organisations that rely on MongoDB for electronic health‑record (EHR) back‑ends or ancillary applications are now exposed to **active exploitation** across the globe (see multiple BleepingComputer, The Hacker News and SecurityAffairs alerts).  \n\nFinally, **supply‑chain compromises of open‑source components (npm, EmEditor, Shai‑Hulud)** and **state‑backed APT activity (Mustang Panda/ HoneyMyte)** demonstrate that the attack surface of health‑care IT environments is expanding beyond traditional ransomware vectors.  These cross‑industry threats can be leveraged against hospitals, insurers, and health‑tech vendors that integrate third‑party code or run outdated web stacks.\n\n**Key take‑aways for health‑care leaders**\n\n| Threat | Why it matters to health‑care | Immediate impact |\n|--------|------------------------------|------------------|\n| **Ransomware (BlackCat/Alphv, TridentLocker, LockBit, Covenant Health incident)** | Direct targeting of patient data, disruption of clinical operations, regulatory fallout (HIPAA, GDPR) | > 475 k patients’ PHI exposed; potential downtime of critical systems |\n| **MongoDB exploitation (CVE‑2025‑14847, CVE‑2025‑14847‑2)** | Many EHR and analytics platforms use MongoDB; active exploitation can lead to data leakage and credential theft | 87 k+ servers already exposed; health‑care databases at risk |\n| **Supply‑chain attacks (Shai‑Hulud npm, EmEditor download‑button malware, Mustang Panda kernel‑mode rootkits)** | Health‑tech SaaS and on‑prem software often embed open‑source libraries; compromised packages can silently deliver ransomware or credential‑stealers | Potential for “drive‑by” infection of clinical workstations and medical‑device management consoles |\n| **State‑sponsored APTs (Mustang Panda/HoneyMyte)** | Targeting of high‑value data (clinical trials, pharma IP) and ability to persist via signed kernel drivers | Long‑term espionage risk, especially for research hospitals and biotech partners |\n\n---\n\n### 2.
