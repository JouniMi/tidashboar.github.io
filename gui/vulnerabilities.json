The malicious template is executed during preview, allowing arbitrary command execution.

The web shell enables persistent remote command execution, data exfiltration, and lateral movement.

It communicates with its C2 over WebSockets, uses delayed beaconing, mimics legitimate processes, and rotates domains through Cloudflare, Heroku, and dynamic DNS. The malware can act as a web server, manipulate the file system, upload/download files, execute arbitrary shell commands, and provide a SOCKS proxy for internal network traversal. A companion in\u2011memory Java servlet filter (BRICKSTEAL) is deployed on VMware vCenter to intercept HTTP Basic authentication and harvest high\u2011privilege credentials, which are then used to clone Windows domain controllers and extract NTDS.dit. Collected credentials are leveraged to access secret stores (e.g., Delinea Secret Server) and to exfiltrate email data via Microsoft Entra ID applications with mail.read or full_access_as_app scopes. After data collection, the actors remove the backdoor and rotate C2 infrastructure to evade forensic analysis.",

By running a malicious app that repeatedly queries low\u2011level graphics buffers (e.g., via the SurfaceFlinger or hardware compositor) and correlating timing differences, the attacker can reconstruct the visual output of other apps. No explicit screen\u2011capture permission is needed because the attack does not invoke the standard screenshot APIs. The reconstructed frames can reveal one\u2011time passwords (OTPs) from authenticator apps, location history from Google Maps, and any other UI\u2011based secrets.

Once foothold is achieved, attackers perform extensive reconnaissance via PowerShell (systeminfo, Get\u2011Service, arp -a, etc.), harvest credentials using cht.exe, Lumma/Berserk stealers, and a keylogger (klg.dll). Lateral movement is performed with stolen credentials, RDP, AnyDesk, PuTTY, and tools like Cobalt Strike and SystemBC. Data is exfiltrated to Azure Blob storage using AzCopy and WinSCP. Encryption is performed by a 64\u2011bit conhost.exe binary (Windows) or a FreeBSD ELF encryptor, employing combined AES\u2011256 and RSA encryption. Encrypted files receive .interlock or .1nt3rlock extensions and a ransom note (!__README__!.txt) delivered via GPO.
