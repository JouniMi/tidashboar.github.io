An attacker can create a fake ERC\u201120 token, deploy a counterfeit liquidity pool with FAVOR, add the pair to allowedDirectPair, and repeatedly invoke the function. Each swap triggers logBuy, which mints ESTEEM rewards without any validation of the pool source. The minted ESTEEM can be converted back to FAVOR, creating a recursive loop that generates unlimited rewards and drains real liquidity. The tax logic in _transfer only applies to whitelisted market pairs, allowing the attacker to bypass the 50% sell tax on the fake pool. Additionally, the oracle TWAP check can be evaded due to low liquidity in the fake pool.",

By using \"mm\" to write NULL or a no\u2011op function pointer to gSecurity2, the signature verification step is bypassed, effectively disabling Secure Boot while the UI still reports it as enabled.

The RAT accepts Base64/JSON commands, executes them, returns output, and maintains persistence via reconnection logic, providing the attacker with a remote shell, data exfiltration capability, and the ability to drop additional payloads.",

      "description": "The Interlock ransomware campaign, active since September 2024, uses compromised legitimate websites to deliver malicious payloads disguised as browser or security\u2011software updates (drive\u2011by compromise). A secondary social\u2011engineering vector, ClickFix, tricks users into executing a Base64\u2011encoded PowerShell command via a fake CAPTCHA. The payload drops a RAT, modifies registry run keys (\"Chrome Updater\"), and adds a startup shortcut for persistence. Once foothold is achieved, attackers perform extensive reconnaissance via PowerShell (systeminfo, Get\u2011Service, arp -a, etc.), harvest credentials using cht.exe, Lumma/Berserk stealers, and a keylogger (klg.dll). Lateral movement is performed with stolen credentials, RDP, AnyDesk, PuTTY, and tools like Cobalt Strike and SystemBC. Data is exfiltrated to Azure Blob storage using AzCopy and WinSCP. Encryption is performed by a 64\u2011bit conhost.exe binary (Windows) or a FreeBSD ELF encryptor, employing combined AES\u2011256 and RSA encryption. Encrypted files receive .interlock or .1nt3rlock extensions and a ransom note (!__README__!.txt) delivered via GPO.

      "description": "The Interlock ransomware campaign, first observed in September 2024, obtains initial access via compromised legitimate websites delivering drive\u2011by downloads that masquerade as browser or security\u2011software updates. A secondary vector, ClickFix, tricks users into executing a Base64\u2011encoded PowerShell command through a fake CAPTCHA. The payload drops a RAT, modifies the Startup folder or registry Run key for persistence, and uses PowerShell to enumerate system information, harvest credentials (cht.exe, Lumma/Berserk stealer, keylogger DLLs), and move laterally via RDP, AnyDesk, PuTTY, and stolen domain admin accounts (possible Kerberoasting). Data is exfiltrated to Azure Blob storage using AzCopy and WinSCP, after which a 64\u2011bit encryptor (conhost.exe) encrypts files with AES\u2011RSA (including a FreeBSD ELF variant) and appends .interlock/.1nt3rlock extensions. A ransom note (!__README__!.txt) is delivered via GPO, providing a .onion contact method. The ransomware also employs defense\u2011evasion techniques such as masquerading (Chrome Updater run key, conhost.exe name), rundll32 proxy execution, and removal of its binaries via tmp41.wasd.",
