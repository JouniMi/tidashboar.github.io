  "summary": "**TECHNOLOGY‑SECTOR THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT**  \n*Coverage window: 30 days (20 Dec 2025 – 29 Dec 2025)*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been dominated by a **wave of vulnerability disclosures and active‑exploitation campaigns that target core technology‑infrastructure components** – firewalls, container runtimes, cloud‑native orchestration tools, and widely‑used open‑source libraries.  CISA’s KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) catalog added three high‑impact flaws (WatchGuard Fireware OS, Digiever NVR, and ASUS Live Update) and multiple vendors (Fortinet, MongoDB, n8n, Docker) released emergency patches after evidence of **real‑world exploitation** surfaced in the wild.  \n\nA parallel trend is the **escalation of supply‑chain abuse of open‑source ecosystems**.  Malicious NPM packages (WhatsApp‑API trojan, “lotusbail”, “lotusbail‑trojan”) and compromised GitHub repositories (WebRAT, fake vulnerability exploits) have been used to deliver credential‑stealing payloads and ransomware droppers at scale.  The same period saw the **Red Hat/GitLab breach** that exposed data of 21 k Nissan customers, underscoring that even “trusted” upstream providers can become the attack vector for downstream technology firms.  \n\nStrategically, threat actors are **blending traditional ransomware tactics with sophisticated encryption schemes (RansomHouse) and AI‑enabled social engineering** (deep‑fake investment scams, AI‑chatbot vulnerability disclosures).  The convergence of AI, cloud‑native tooling, and legacy network security appliances creates a broad attack surface that adversaries are exploiting with **multi‑stage, multi‑vector campaigns**.  \n\n**Key take‑aways for technology organisations**\n\n| Issue | Why it matters to tech | Immediate impact |\n|-------|------------------------|------------------|\n| **Critical firewall & VPN flaws (WatchGuard, Fortinet, Digiever)** | Core perimeter defence for data‑centres, SaaS, and on‑prem environments. | Active exploitation → remote code execution, credential theft, network pivot. |\n| **Open‑source supply‑chain compromises (malicious NPM, GitHub‑hosted WebRAT, compromised Docker images)** | Development pipelines, CI/CD, and container orchestration depend on these artefacts. | Malware injection, credential harvesting, ransomware dropper delivery. |\n| **High‑severity database & application platform bugs (MongoDB RCE, n8n arbitrary‑code execution, LangChain serialization injection)** | Backend services for SaaS, analytics, AI‑driven products. | Full server takeover, data exfiltration, model poisoning. |\n| **AI‑related abuse (prompt‑injection in LangChain, deep‑fake scams, AI‑chatbot vulnerability blackmail)** | AI is now a product feature and a security research surface. | Credential theft, brand damage, regulatory scrutiny. |\n| **Supply‑chain breach of trusted vendors (Red Hat/GitLab, ServiceNow‑Armis acquisition signalling increased IoT focus)** | Third‑party risk for any tech stack that consumes SaaS or open‑source components. | Exposure of customer data, downstream compromise of managed services. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Group | Primary Targets in Technology | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) | Notable Campaigns (30‑day window) |\n|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **WatchGuard‑focused exploit kits** (likely financially‑motivated cyber‑crime groups) | Enterprise firewalls, VPN appliances | Exploit of CVE‑2025‑59374 (ASUS Live Update) and WatchGuard RCE (CVE‑2025‑xxxx) → remote code execution, credential dumping | “Critical RCE flaw impacts >115 k WatchGuard firewalls” (22 Dec) – active exploitation reported by CISA. |\n| **Fortinet‑targeted actors** (e.g., ransomware‑as‑a‑service groups) | FortiOS SSL‑VPN gateways | 2FA‑bypass, credential harvesting, lateral movement | “Fortinet Warns of Active Exploitation of FortiOS SSL VPN 2FA Bypass” (25 Dec). |\n| **Supply‑chain malware distributors** (e.g., “WebRAT” operators, “Fake WhatsApp API” authors) | Open‑source package registries (npm, PyPI), GitHub repos | Publish trojanised packages, use signed macOS apps, embed droppers in Docker images | “WebRAT malware spread via fake vulnerability exploits on GitHub” (23 Dec); “Fake WhatsApp API package steals messages” (16 Dec). |\n| **State‑linked APTs** – *Evasive Panda* (China‑linked) | DNS infrastructure, IoT devices, cloud workloads | DNS poisoning, delivery of MgBot malware, credential harvesting | “Evasive Panda APT poisons DNS requests to deliver MgBot” (24 Dec); “China‑Linked Evasive Panda ran DNS poisoning” (26 Dec). |\n| **Ransomware‑as‑a‑service groups** – *RansomHouse* | Enterprise data stores, SaaS platforms | Multi‑layered encryption, custom ransomware payloads | “RansomHouse upgrades encryption with multi‑layered data processing” (20 Dec). |\n| **AI‑enabled social engineers** (deep‑fake scammers, AI‑chatbot exploit reporters) | End‑users, SaaS providers, cloud AI services | Deep‑fake video, prompt‑injection, blackmail of researchers | “Nomani Investment Scam Surges 62 % Using AI Deepfake Ads” (24 Dec); “Eurostar blackmail for reporting AI chatbot flaws” (24 Dec). |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risk Assessment**  \n- **Red Hat/GitLab breach** (21 Dec) exposed 21 k Nissan customers, demonstrating that a single compromised upstream component can cascade to multiple downstream OEMs and SaaS providers.  \n- **Third‑party access weakness** highlighted in “Why third‑party access remains the weak link in supply chain security” (23 Dec) – a recurring theme across the month.  \n- **NPM trojanisation** (WhatsApp‑API, lotusbail, malicious package with 56 k downloads) shows attackers are targeting the **software‑development supply chain** to gain footholds in otherwise trusted CI/CD pipelines.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
