  "summary": "**TECHNOLOGY‑SECTOR THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT**  \n*Coverage window: 30 days (30 Dec 2025 – 5 Jan 2026)*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been dominated by **supply‑chain abuse, kernel‑mode rootkits, and rapid exploitation of newly disclosed software vulnerabilities** that directly affect core technology platforms – operating systems, development toolchains, cloud services, and API gateways.  Chinese‑state‑aligned APT “Mustang Panda/​HoneyMyte” repeatedly leveraged **signed kernel‑mode drivers** to install the **ToneShell** backdoor on Windows and macOS endpoints, demonstrating a maturing capability to bypass driver‑signing enforcement.  Simultaneously, **open‑source ecosystems (npm, VS Code, EmEditor)** have become fertile ground for **malicious package insertion** and **extension‑based malware** (e.g., the Shai‑Hulud npm worm, DarkSpectre browser extensions, and the VS Code “recommended‑extension” attack).  \n\nA second, equally critical trend is the **active exploitation of high‑severity vulnerabilities** that were disclosed only weeks earlier: **MongoDB CVE‑2025‑14847 (“MongoBleed”)**, **IBM API Connect authentication bypass**, and **React2Shell (CVE‑2025‑xxxx)**.  Threat actors—including the **RondoDox botnet**, **Kimwolf Android botnet**, and **Silver Fox** phishing‑campaigns—have weaponised these flaws to compromise cloud‑hosted services, IoT devices, and mobile platforms at scale.  \n\nStrategically, the technology sector now faces a **confluence of supply‑chain risk, driver‑level persistence, and rapid vulnerability weaponisation**.  Organizations that rely on open‑source components, cloud‑native stacks, or legacy driver signing processes are exposed to the highest probability of breach.  Defensive postures must therefore prioritize **SBOM hygiene, hardened driver policies, and accelerated patch‑to‑protect cycles**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Campaign | Primary Targets (Technology) | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) | Notable Articles |\n|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|\n| **Mustang Panda / HoneyMyte** (Chinese APT) | Windows & macOS workstations, enterprise endpoints | • Signed kernel‑mode rootkit driver → loads **ToneShell** backdoor  <br>• Use of legitimate driver signing certificates <br>• Persistence via kernel hooks, stealthy C2 over HTTPS | “Mustang Panda deploys ToneShell via signed kernel‑mode rootkit driver” (SecurityAffairs, 30 Dec 2025); “HoneyMyte (aka Mustang Panda) Deploys ToneShell Backdoor in New Attacks” (HackRead, 30 Dec 2025); “The HoneyMyte APT evolves with a kernel‑mode rootkit and a ToneShell backdoor” (Securelist, 10 Dec 2025) |\n| **Shai‑Hulud / npm‑worm** (Supply‑chain malware) | npm registry, JavaScript/Node.js projects, crypto wallet extensions (Trust Wallet) | • Publish malicious npm packages that execute payloads on install <br>• Target Chrome extensions (Trust Wallet) <br>• Use of obfuscated JavaScript to evade scanners | “Shai‑Hulud Supply Chain Attack Led to $8.5 Million Trust Wallet Heist” (SecurityWeek, 31 Dec 2025); “Researchers Spot Modified Shai‑Hulud Worm Testing Payload on npm Registry” (The Hacker News, 31 Dec 2025); “Trust Wallet Chrome Extension Hack Drains $8.5M via Shai‑Hulud Supply Chain Attack” (The Hacker News, 31 Dec 2025) |\n| **RondoDox Botnet** | IoT devices, web servers running React2Shell, Next.js, generic Linux hosts | • Exploits **React2Shell** remote‑code‑execution flaw <br>• Deploys cryptominers & secondary payloads <br>• Uses residential proxy networks for C2 | “RondoDox Botnet Exploits Critical React2Shell Flaw to Hijack IoT Devices and Web Servers” (The Hacker News, 1 Jan 2026); “RondoDox botnet exploits React2Shell flaw to breach Next.js servers” (BleepingComputer, 31 Dec 2025); “RondoDox Botnet is Using React2Shell to Hijack Thousands of Unpatched Devices” (HackRead, 3 Jan 2026) |\n| **Silver Fox** (Financial‑themed phishing) | Indian corporate users, Windows workstations | • Phishing emails with tax‑season lures <br>• Delivery of **ValleyRAT** (remote‑access trojan) | “Silver Fox Targets Indian Users With Tax‑Themed Emails Delivering ValleyRAT Malware” (The Hacker News, 30 Dec 2025) |\n| **Kimwolf Botnet** | Android smartphones (2 M+ devices) | • Leverages residential proxies, hijacks Android via malicious apps <br>• Payloads include ad‑fraud and data exfiltration | “Kimwolf botnet leverages residential proxies to hijack 2M+ Android devices” (SecurityAffairs, 5 Jan 2026); “Kimwolf Android Botnet Grows Through Residential Proxy Networks” (SecurityWeek, 5 Jan 2026) |\n| **Various Open‑Source Abuse Groups** (npm, VS Code, EmEditor) | Developers, CI/CD pipelines, end‑users of extensions | • Publish malicious packages (27 npm packages used for credential phishing) <br>• Compromise VS Code “recommended‑extension” feed <br>• Inject malware into EmEditor download button | “27 Malicious npm Packages Used as Phishing Infrastructure to Steal Login Credentials” (The Hacker News, 29 Dec 2025); “VSCode IDE forks expose users to ‘recommended extension’ attacks” (BleepingComputer, 5 Jan 2026); “Infostealer Malware Delivered in EmEditor Supply Chain Attack” (SecurityWeek, 29 Dec 2025) |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risk Assessment** – The **Shai‑Hulud npm worm**, **VS Code extension hijack**, and **EmEditor download‑button malware** illustrate a clear shift toward **targeting the software development lifecycle**.  Attackers are exploiting the trust placed in package registries and IDE recommendation engines, making SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) verification and provenance checks essential.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
