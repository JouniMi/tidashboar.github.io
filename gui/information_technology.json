  "summary": "**TECHNOLOGY‑SECTOR THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT**  \n*Coverage window: 30 days (30 Dec 2025 – 6 Jan 2026)*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been defined by **supply‑chain abuse of open‑source ecosystems**, **rapid weaponisation of newly disclosed high‑severity vulnerabilities**, and **the convergence of generative‑AI with classic malware‑delivery techniques**.  Attackers are increasingly targeting the *software development lifecycle* (npm, VS Code, n8n, AdonisJS, IBM API Connect) and the *cloud‑native stack* (React2Shell, Next.js, Google Cloud, Fortinet firewalls).  At the same time, **AI‑driven credential‑theft and prompt‑injection campaigns** are emerging as a new attack vector against both developers and end‑users of large‑language‑model (LLM) services.\n\nKey patterns:\n\n| Pattern | Representative incidents (title) | Impact on Technology orgs |\n|---------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Open‑source supply‑chain compromise** | “Researchers Spot Modified Shai‑Hulud Worm Testing Payload on npm Registry”, “VSCode IDE forks expose users to ‘recommended extension’ attacks”, “New n8n Vulnerability (9.9 CVSS) Lets Authenticated Users Execute System Commands” | Compromise of build pipelines, credential theft, downstream distribution of malicious packages. |\n| **Critical zero‑day/near‑zero‑day exploits** | “Critical CVSS 9.8 Flaw in IBM API Connect Authentication”, “MongoBleed (CVE‑2025‑14847)”, “Critical AdonisJS Bodyparser Flaw (CVSS 9.2)”, “New D‑Link DSL‑router flaw actively exploited” | Immediate remote code execution (RCE) on enterprise APIs, databases, web frameworks, and networking gear – forcing rapid patching cycles. |\n| **Botnet‑driven IoT & cloud abuse** | “RondoDox Botnet Exploits Critical React2Shell Flaw”, “Kimwolf Android Botnet leverages residential proxies”, “Fortinet firewalls exposed to 2FA bypass” | Large‑scale hijacking of edge devices, credential‑stuffing on network appliances, and creation of “cryptomining‑as‑a‑service” platforms. |\n| **AI‑enabled social engineering & malware** | “OpenAI is offering $20 ChatGPT Plus for free to some users”, “Two Chrome Extensions Caught Stealing ChatGPT and DeepSeek Chats”, “Are Copilot prompt‑injection flaws vulnerabilities or AI limits?”, “How generative AI accelerates identity attacks against Active Directory” | Theft of LLM‑generated content, credential harvesting via compromised extensions, and novel injection attacks against development tools. |\n| **Cross‑industry ransomware & data‑exfiltration** | “Everest Ransomware Leaks 1 TB of Stolen ASUS Data”, “ClickFix fake BSOD screens push malware”, “Sedgwick data breach after TridentLocker ransomware” | Ransomware continues to target technology manufacturers (ASUS) and service providers, highlighting the need for hardened backup and incident‑response processes. |\n\n**Strategic implication:**  Technology firms must treat *software supply‑chain integrity* as a core security control, accelerate *vulnerability management* for cloud‑native stacks, and embed *AI‑risk governance* into product development lifecycles.  Failure to do so will expose critical services to rapid, large‑scale compromise and regulatory fallout (e.g., GDPR, CISA KEV compliance).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Threat Actor / Group | Targeted Technology Assets | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) | Notable Campaigns (30‑day window) |\n|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Shai‑Hulud (supply‑chain) / “Modified Shai‑Hulud Worm”** | npm registry, Chrome extensions, crypto wallets (Trust Wallet) | Package tampering, malicious post‑install scripts, credential‑stealing extensions | “Researchers Spot Modified Shai‑Hulud Worm Testing Payload on npm Registry”, “Trust Wallet Chrome Extension Hack Drains $8.5 M” |\n| **RondoDox Botnet** | IoT devices, web servers running React2Shell, Next.js, other Node.js stacks | Exploits CVE‑2025‑xxxx React2Shell, drops miners & ransomware, uses proxy‑chains | “RondoDox Botnet Exploits Critical React2Shell Flaw”, “RondoDox Botnet Exploiting React2Shell to Breach Next.js Servers” |\n| **Kimwolf Botnet** | Android devices (2 M+), residential proxy networks | Exploits exposed ADB, uses proxy farms for lateral movement, delivers ad‑ware & credential‑stealers | “Kimwolf botnet leverages residential proxies to hijack 2M+ Android devices”, “Kimwolf Android Botnet Grows Through Residential Proxy Networks” |\n| **APT‑UAC‑0184 (Russia‑linked)** | Viber, Ukrainian military communications | Use of legitimate messaging apps for C2, data exfiltration | “Russia‑linked APT UAC‑0184 uses Viber to spy on Ukrainian military in 2025” |\n| **State‑sponsored “Predator” actors** (post‑sanctions) | Commercial spyware, surveillance tools | Distribution of advanced spyware kits, targeting of high‑value tech executives | “U.S. Treasury Lifts Sanctions on Three Individuals Linked to Intellexa and Predator Spyware” |\n| **Lapsus$‑style opportunists** (e.g., “ShinyHunters”) | Security‑service firms, open‑source repos | Honeypot baiting, credential harvesting, extortion | “Resecurity Says ShinyHunters Fell for Honeypot After Breach Claim” |\n| **AI‑enabled cyber‑criminals** (no single group) | LLM‑integrated extensions, Copilot, ChatGPT | Prompt‑injection, credential‑stealing via compromised extensions, “ChatGPT‑stealer” Chrome extensions | “Two Chrome Extensions Caught Stealing ChatGPT and DeepSeek Chats”, “Are Copilot prompt‑injection flaws vulnerabilities or AI limits?” |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risk Assessment** – The *npm* and *VS Code* ecosystems have become repeat targets.  The “Shai‑Hulud” worm demonstrates that a single malicious package can cascade into high‑value crypto‑wallet thefts, while the VS Code “recommended‑extension” abuse shows that even vetted marketplace mechanisms can be subverted.  The *n8n* workflow‑automation platform and *AdonisJS* web framework also suffered near‑zero‑day abuse, indicating attackers are actively scanning for newly disclosed CVEs across the open‑source stack.\n\n**Botnet Evolution** – RondoDox and Kimwolf illustrate a shift from traditional DDoS‑oriented botnets to *resource‑monetisation* (cryptomining) and *credential‑theft* at scale, leveraging newly disclosed flaws (React2Shell, ADB exposure).  Their use of residential proxies complicates attribution and mitigation.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
