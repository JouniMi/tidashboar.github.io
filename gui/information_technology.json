  "summary": "**Technology‑Sector Threat Intelligence Report – 30‑day Window (23 Dec 2025 – 31 Dec 2025)**  \n*Prepared by: Senior Cyber‑Security Analyst – Technology Practice*  \n\n---  \n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been marked by a **convergence of three high‑impact trends** that dominate the technology threat landscape:\n\n1. **Supply‑chain abuse of open‑source ecosystems** – malicious NPM packages, compromised software download pages (EmEditor, MongoDB), and signed‑driver/root‑kit campaigns (Mustang Panda, HoneyMyte) are delivering payloads directly to developers, CI/CD pipelines, and end‑users.  \n2. **Rapid exploitation of newly disclosed, high‑severity vulnerabilities** – CVE‑2025‑14847 (MongoDB “MongoBleed”), FortiOS SSL‑VPN 2FA bypass, IBM API Connect authentication bypass, and the Digiever NVR RCE are already being weaponised in the wild, often within days of public disclosure.  \n3. **AI‑driven attack vectors and platform‑specific malware** – AI‑generated deep‑fake social‑engineering, prompt‑injection bugs in LangChain, and OS‑specific stealer families (MacSync, GlassWorm) are expanding the attack surface of both enterprise and consumer tech stacks.\n\n**Strategic implications:**  \n- **Development teams** are the new front line; compromised build tools or package registries can compromise thousands of downstream products.  \n- **Cloud‑SaaS and collaboration platforms** (Microsoft Teams, OpenAI, Zoom) are being hardened, but mis‑configurations and third‑party extensions remain a major risk.  \n- **Regulatory pressure** on major platform owners (Apple ATT fine, EU/US scrutiny of AI advertising) is increasing compliance costs and may drive rapid architectural changes (e.g., Microsoft’s Rust migration).  \n\n**Critical security topics for technology organisations**  \n\n| Topic | Why it matters now | Immediate actions |\n|-------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| **Open‑source supply‑chain hygiene** | 7 + high‑profile NPM‑based compromises (lotusbail, 56 k‑download package, 27 malicious npm packages) and the EmEditor download‑page malware. | Adopt SBOMs, enforce signed packages, monitor npm registry activity, enable provenance verification (Sigstore). |\n| **Active exploitation of MongoDB (CVE‑2025‑14847) & “MongoBleed”** | > 80 k servers exposed; CISA added to KEV catalog; active exploitation reported worldwide. | Patch immediately, enforce network segmentation, enable authentication, rotate credentials. |\n| **Kernel‑mode root‑kit campaigns (Mustang Panda, HoneyMyte)** | Signed drivers used to bypass Windows driver signing, delivering ToneShell/Backdoor. | Enforce Secure Boot, enable kernel‑mode code signing policies, monitor driver load events. |\n| **AI platform attack surface** (LangChain prompt‑injection, OpenAI ad‑sponsored content, deep‑fake scams) | AI is now a primary vector for social engineering and supply‑chain compromise. | Harden AI model inputs, apply prompt‑sanitisation, train staff on AI‑phishing, audit third‑party AI integrations. |\n| **Browser‑extension abuse** (Zoom Stealer, DarkSpectre, Chrome‑extension wallet hacks) | Extensions now harvest credentials, crypto wallets, and corporate meeting intel. | Enforce extension whitelisting, use CSP/extension‑policy, conduct regular extension audits. |\n| **Regulatory & compliance shifts** (Apple ATT fine, EU/US AI‑ad rules) | Platform owners are forced to redesign data‑collection and advertising pipelines. | Review data‑privacy impact assessments, adjust consent flows, prepare for possible sandboxing of ad‑tech. |\n\n---  \n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Group | Motivation | Primary Targets in Technology | Notable Campaigns (30‑day window) |\n|---------------|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Evasive Panda (APT)** | State‑sponsored (China) – espionage & data exfiltration | DNS infrastructure, enterprise networks, supply‑chain of SaaS | DNS‑poisoning to deliver **MgBot** malware (Dec 24) |\n| **Mustang Panda / HoneyMyte (APT)** | State‑sponsored (China) – long‑term foothold, espionage | Windows kernel, enterprise VPNs, cloud workloads | Signed kernel‑mode rootkit delivering **ToneShell** (Dec 30, Dec 31) |\n| **Shai‑Hulud (Cyber‑crime syndicate)** | Financial gain – crypto‑wallet theft | Crypto wallet extensions, NPM registry, supply‑chain of wallet software | Trust Wallet Chrome‑extension supply‑chain attack (Dec 31) |\n| **KMSAuto author (Lithuanian criminal)** | Ransomware‑as‑a‑service | Windows servers, enterprise endpoints | Arrested after infecting 2.8 M systems (Dec 30) |\n| **GlassWorm authors** | Financial – crypto‑miner/stealer | macOS users, Apple ecosystem | New macOS trojanised wallet (Dec 31) |\n| **RondoDox Botnet** | Financial – cryptomining & ransomware | Web servers running vulnerable **React2Shell** (Next.js) | Exploits React2Shell to hijack IoT & web servers (Jan 1) |\n| **Various cyber‑crime “phisherfolk”** | Credential harvesting | Password‑hoarding platforms, phishing kits | US shutdown of $14.6 M password‑hoarding platform (Dec 24) |\n| **Pro‑Russian hacktivist groups (Noname057, etc.)** | Ideological – disruption of state services | Postal services, government portals | Claims of La Poste attack (Dec 26) – not directly tech‑sector but demonstrates geopolitical targeting of critical‑infrastructure platforms. |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risk Assessment**  \n\n- **Signed driver/root‑kit abuse** (Mustang Panda, HoneyMyte) shows that even “trusted” binaries can be weaponised when the signing process is compromised or abused.  \n- **NPM ecosystem** is a hotbed: malicious packages (lotusbail, 56 k‑download package, 27 phishing‑infrastructure packages) have been used to deliver credential‑stealers, WhatsApp trojans, and crypto‑wallet malware.  \n- **Software download pages** (EmEditor, MongoDB, MongoBleed) are being compromised to serve malicious binaries directly to end‑users.  \n\n---  \n\n## 3.
