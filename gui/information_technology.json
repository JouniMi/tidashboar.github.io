  "summary": "**TECHNOLOGY‑SECTOR THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT**  \n*Coverage window: 30 days (12 Dec 2025 – 12 Jan 2026)*  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been defined by a **confluence of high‑impact software supply‑chain flaws, aggressive exploitation of network‑device firmware, and a surge in AI‑enabled tooling** that is being weaponised across both state‑backed and financially‑motivated groups.  Ten + critical‑severity CVEs (CVSS ≥ 9.0) were disclosed for core infrastructure vendors – **Cisco, SonicWall, WatchGuard, HPE OneView, ASUS Live Update, and multiple UEFI/BIOS implementations** – and all have been confirmed as **actively exploited in the wild** (CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog additions on 12 Dec 2025).  \n\nSimultaneously, **cloud‑credential abuse** (stolen AWS keys used for illicit crypto‑mining) and **container‑runtime AI attacks** (Docker “Ask Gordon” metadata‑extraction flaw) demonstrate that attackers are moving from traditional perimeter‑focused tactics to **cloud‑native, supply‑chain, and AI‑driven attack surfaces**.  The **Android ecosystem** remains a fertile hunting ground, with the **Kimwolf botnet** now exceeding 1.8 M devices and the **DocSwap**/“GhostPairing” campaigns targeting WhatsApp and other messaging apps via malicious QR codes and npm packages.  \n\n**Strategic implications for technology organisations**:  \n\n* **Patch velocity is now a competitive advantage** – many of the disclosed flaws are being weaponised within days of public disclosure.  \n* **Supply‑chain hygiene must extend to open‑source ecosystems** (npm, Docker Hub, third‑party monitoring tools) where malicious packages are being used to exfiltrate credentials and inject ransomware.  \n* **AI‑assisted threat tooling** (e.g., “DIG AI” darknet assistant, AI‑generated phishing, and AI‑driven reconnaissance) is lowering the barrier for low‑skill actors, expanding the threat‑actor pool.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Group | Primary Targets in Technology | Notable Campaigns / TTPs | Sources |\n|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| **China‑linked APT (UAT‑9686, “LongNosedGoblin”)** | Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email & Web Manager, other network appliances | Zero‑day exploitation of Cisco AsyncOS, credential‑stealing via compromised email appliances | 12 Dec 2025 – “Cisco Warns of Active Attacks…”, 19 Dec 2025 – “China‑linked APT UAT‑9686…” |\n| **North‑Korean “Lazarus” / “Kim” groups** | Cryptocurrency exchanges, cloud platforms (AWS), SaaS infrastructure | Large‑scale crypto theft ($2 B), use of stolen AWS credentials for illicit mining, “BeaverTail” embedded in developer tools | 12 Dec 2025 – “North Korea‑Linked Hackers Steal $2.02 B…”, 18 Dec 2025 – “Lazarus Group Embed New BeaverTail…” |\n| **Kimsuky (North‑Korean‑linked)** | Android devices, enterprise messaging (WhatsApp) | DocSwap Android malware via QR‑phishing, “GhostPairing” hijacking of WhatsApp accounts | 18 Dec 2025 – “Kimsuky Spreads DocSwap…”, 18 Dec 2025 – “GhostPairing campaign…” |\n| **Crypto‑focused financially‑motivated actors** | Cloud service providers (AWS, Azure), SaaS platforms, Docker Hub | Credential theft for crypto‑mining, ransomware‑as‑a‑service (RansomHouse), multi‑layer encryption upgrades | 18 Dec 2025 – “Crypto crooks co‑opt stolen AWS creds…”, 20 Dec 2025 – “RansomHouse upgrades encryption…” |\n| **Hacktivist / Open‑source abuse groups** | npm ecosystem, Docker images, monitoring tools (Nezha) | Malicious npm packages stealing WhatsApp tokens, “Ask Gordon” AI flaw in Docker, Nezha trojanisation | 22 Dec 2025 – “Fake WhatsApp API Package on npm…”, 19 Dec 2025 – “Docker Fixes ‘Ask Gordon’ AI Flaw…”, 22 Dec 2025 – “Hackers Abuse Popular Monitoring Tool Nezha…” |\n| **State‑sponsored espionage (Iranian INFY, Prince of Persia)** | Windows Group Policy, enterprise VPNs, macOS development tools | Deployment of custom espionage malware via Group Policy, macOS Swift‑signed dropper (MacSync) | 18 Dec 2025 – “China‑Aligned Threat Group Uses Windows Group Policy…”, 22 Dec 2025 – “MacSync macOS Malware…” |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risks** – The most acute risk stems from **firmware/UEFI vulnerabilities** (ASRock, ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI) that enable **pre‑boot DMA attacks** and are being weaponised before patches are available.  The **Docker “Ask Gordon”** AI flaw demonstrates that **container‑runtime metadata** can be abused to extract secrets from images, a vector that directly impacts CI/CD pipelines across the sector.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
