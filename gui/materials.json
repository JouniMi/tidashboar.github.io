  "summary": "**Materials Sector Cyber Threat Assessment**  \n**Reporting Period:** 30 Days (January 22 – February 20, 2026)  \n**Prepared by:** Cybersecurity Intelligence Division – Materials Sector Practice  \n**Classification:** Sensitive – Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES)  \n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nOver the past 30 days, the Materials sector has been exposed to a confluence of high-impact, cross-industry threats—primarily supply chain compromises, critical infrastructure targeting, and exploitation of legacy protocol vulnerabilities—with increasing convergence between IT and OT environments. While no *exclusive* Materials-sector breaches were reported, multiple campaigns explicitly targeted adjacent or upstream industries (e.g., Energy, Industrial Control Systems, and Critical Infrastructure), which directly impact Materials production, logistics, and R&D ecosystems. Notably, the **Sandworm-linked wiper attack on Poland’s power grid** (Jan 24–26) and the **multi-stage phishing campaign targeting energy firms using SharePoint** (Jan 23, 26) represent direct threats to Materials organizations reliant on uninterrupted power and integrated OT/IT operations. These incidents underscore the sector’s exposure to nation-state–level disruptive capabilities and supply chain weaponization.\n\nA critical emerging pattern is the exploitation of **legacy telnet services** (CVE-2026-24061, an 11-year-old flaw in GNU InetUtils) across industrial networks. With nearly 800,000 telnet servers exposed globally, Materials facilities—especially older smelters, refineries, and chemical plants still operating unpatched embedded systems—are at elevated risk of lateral movement and OT disruption. Additionally, the **FortiGate SSO bypass attacks** (repeatedly confirmed as active *even on patched devices* through Jan 23–24) threaten perimeter security for Materials firms using Fortinet firewalls for remote access to engineering systems and ERP platforms. The convergence of these threats—legacy protocol abuse, SSO exploitation, and OT-targeted wipers—creates a high-risk vector for production shutdowns, data exfiltration (e.g., proprietary alloy formulations, process control logic), and physical safety incidents.\n\nStrategically, the Materials sector faces heightened risk from **AI-augmented supply chain attacks** (e.g., malicious VS Code extensions with 1.5M installs stealing source code) and **identity-centric campaigns** (ShinyHunters’ Okta/SSO thefts affecting Canva, Crunchbase, and others), which compromise engineering and procurement systems where sensitive IP resides. With 72M+ records breached in the Under Armour incident and ShinyHunters claiming 2M Crunchbase records, credential reuse and identity fatigue remain systemic vulnerabilities. The sector must prioritize OT/IT convergence risk assessments, SSO hardening, and legacy protocol remediation as top defensive priorities.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Actor Intelligence\n\n### Key Actors Affecting Materials:\n1. **Sandworm (APT28-affiliated, GRU-linked)**  \n   - **Activity:** Deployed **DynoWiper** malware in an attempted attack on Poland’s power grid (Jan 24), leveraging a VMware vCenter RCE (CVE-2024-37079) to gain initial access.  \n   - **Materials Relevance:** Direct threat to Materials firms with integrated energy infrastructure (e.g., aluminum smelters, steel mills). Wiper attacks aim to disrupt operations and obscure data theft—critical for stealing process parameters or intellectual property.  \n   - **TTPs:** Multi-stage phishing → VMware exploitation → lateral movement → wiper deployment.\n\n2. **ShinyHunters**  \n   - **Activity:** Claimed compromise of Okta customer data (Jan 23–26), affecting Canva, Crunchbase, and others. Also breached 2M Crunchbase records (Jan 26).  \n   - **Materials Relevance:** Materials companies using Okta for SSO across engineering, procurement, and supplier portals are at high risk of identity theft and lateral access to R&D systems. Crunchbase data includes supplier financials and compliance status—key for supply chain intelligence gathering.\n\n3. **KONNI (North Korea, LAPSUS$-affiliated)**  \n   - **Activity:** Deployed AI-generated PowerShell backdoors against blockchain engineers (Jan 26) and used AI to build stealthy tooling (Jan 26).  \n   - **Materials Relevance:** Increasing focus on critical minerals and battery supply chains (e.g., lithium, cobalt, rare earths). Materials firms involved in EV battery R&D or mining automation are likely targets for IP theft or sabotage.\n\n4. **Scattered Spider / Crims**  \n   - **Activity:** Sold voice phishing (vishing) kits targeting SSO accounts (Jan 22–23); compromised energy firms’ Microsoft accounts to send 600+ phishing emails (Jan 22).  \n   - **Materials Relevance:** High-impact for Materials firms with outsourced helpdesks or weak MFA enforcement. SSO compromise enables access to SAP, Oracle Cloud, and engineering CAD systems.\n\n### Supply Chain Risks:\n- **VS Code AI Extensions:** Malicious extensions (e.g., impersonating legitimate tools) with 1.5M installs stole developer source code (Jan 23, 26). Materials R&D teams using AI-assisted coding for materials simulation (e.g., DFT modeling) are vulnerable.  \n- **PyPI Package Impersonation (SymPy → XMRig):** While labeled “software development,” this impacts Materials firms running computational modeling (e.g., finite element analysis, thermodynamic simulations) that depend on Python scientific libraries.  \n- **Legacy Telnet Exploitation (CVE-2026-24061):** Affects embedded controllers in older process monitoring systems—common in legacy Materials plants.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Threat Analysis\n\n### Critical Vulnerabilities Affecting Materials:\n| CVE | Product | Status | Materials Impact |\n|-----|---------|--------|------------------|\n| **CVE-2026-24061** | GNU InetUtils telnetd | Actively exploited | Enables root access to legacy OT devices (PLCs, HMIs) in Materials facilities. 800K+ exposed servers globally. |\n| **CVE-2026-20045** | Cisco Unified CM/Webex | Actively exploited | Compromises voice/UC systems used for plant coordination and emergency response. |\n| **FortiCloud SSO Bypass** | Fortinet FortiGate | Actively exploited *even on patched devices* (Jan 23–24) | Allows attackers to alter firewall rules, disable logging, and steal configs—critical for bypassing network segmentation between IT and OT. |\n| **CVE-2024-37079** | VMware vCenter Server | Actively exploited | Used by Sandworm in wiper attacks; affects virtualized engineering workstations and simulation clusters. |\n\n### Malware & Tools:\n- **DynoWiper:** Targeted Polish energy grid; designed to destroy data and disrupt operations. Materials firms with grid-tied operations (e.g., electrolytic aluminum) are high-priority targets.  \n- **Osiris Ransomware:** New strain using **BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver)** to disable security tools (Jan 22, 24). Threatens endpoint security on engineering workstations storing sensitive formulations.  \n- **Stanley Toolkit:** $6,000 phishing kit that spoofs secure URLs in Chrome (Jan 26). Used in campaigns targeting energy firms—Materials procurement teams are likely secondary targets.  \n- **Amatera Stealer:** Distributed via fake CAPTCHA scams (Jan 26); steals credentials and session tokens—high risk for cloud-based ERP (e.g., SAP S/4HANA) used in Materials inventory and logistics.\n\n### Attack Vectors:\n- **SSO/Identity Theft:** FortiCloud and Okta bypasses enable credential theft and session hijacking.  \n- **Legacy Protocol Abuse:** Telnet (CVE-2026-24061) remains a critical exposure point in older Materials plants.  \n- **Supply Chain Compromise:** VS Code extensions and PyPI packages target developer environments where materials science code is written.  \n- **Phishing → RMM Abuse:** Attacks using stolen credentials to install LogMeIn RMM (Jan 23) for persistent access—common in remote engineering support scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Intelligence\n\n### Sub-Sector Risk Assessment:\n| Sub-Sector | Key Risks | High-Impact Incidents |\n|------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| **Metals & Mining** | OT disruption (wipers), legacy telnet exposure, supply chain IP theft | Sandworm attack on energy grid (Jan 24–26); telnet exploits (CVE-2026-24061) |\n| **Chemicals & Polymers** | R&D data theft (formulations, processes), cloud ERP compromise | ShinyHunters Okta campaign (Jan 26); VS Code code theft (Jan 26) |\n| **Ceramics & Composites** | Engineering workstation compromise, simulation tool hijacking | PyPI/XMRig (Jan 22); Osiris BYOVD (Jan 24) |\n| **Building Materials & Construction** | Supply chain phishing, logistics system disruption | SharePoint phishing (energy sector, Jan 23, 26); vishing kits (Jan 22–23) |\n\n### High-Impact Incidents with Materials Relevance:\n1. **DynoWiper Attack on Polish Power Grid (Jan 24–26)**  \n   - **Impact:** Attempted grid disruption; materials used in power generation (e.g., turbine alloys, refractory ceramics) could be compromised via supply chain intelligence.  \n   - **Lesson:** Materials firms must assume OT networks are reachable via IT—segmentation alone is insufficient.\n\n2. **ShinyHunters Okta/SSO Campaign (Jan 23–26)**  \n   - **Impact:** 3+ orgs confirmed breached; Canva, Crunchbase, and others compromised.  \n   - **Lesson:** Materials firms using Okta must audit SSO policies, enforce FIDO2 keys, and monitor for anomalous login locations (e.g., non-corporate IPs).\n\n3. **FortiGate SSO Bypass (Jan 22–24)**  \n   - **Impact:** Attackers altered firewall configs and stole credentials *despite patching*.  \n   - **Lesson:** Materials firms must assume Fortinet devices are compromised if exposed to the internet; prioritize air-gapping OT firewalls.\n\n### Incident Response Insights:\n- **Ransomware Opsec Failures:** INC ransomware’s data recovery (Jan 22) highlights that attackers often leave forensic traces—emphasizing the need for immutable backups.  \n- **Identity Theft Recovery:** ShinyHunters’ reuse of stolen SSO tokens shows that credential resets alone are insufficient; session invalidation and device binding are critical.  \n- **Legacy System Risks:** Telnet exploitation proves that “out of support” devices remain operational in Materials facilities—requiring network micro-segmentation and deep packet inspection.\n\n---\n\n## Forward-Looking Assessment\n\n### Emerging Threats (Next 60–90 Days):\n1. **AI-Augmented OT Attacks:** KONNI’s AI-built malware (Jan 26) signals a shift toward adaptive, evasive tooling. Expect AI-generated payloads targeting industrial protocols (Modbus, DNP3) in Materials OT environments.  \n2. **Supply Chain Weaponization of DevOps Tools:** Malicious VS Code/PyPI extensions will increasingly target materials science libraries (e.g., Materials Project APIs, LAMMPS simulations).  \n3. **Telnet Exploitation at Scale:** With 800K+ exposed servers, automated scanners will pivot from IT to OT networks—Materials firms with unpatched embedded systems face imminent compromise.  \n4. **SSO-as-a-Service Abuse:** Crims’ vishing kits will be used to target Materials procurement teams, enabling BEC attacks against supplier payments.\n\n### Recommended Defensive Priorities:\n| Priority | Action | Rationale |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| **1. Legacy Protocol Remediation** | Disable telnet/FTP on all OT/ICS devices; deploy protocol-aware firewalls (e.g., Claroty, Dragos). | CVE-2026-24061 is trivial to exploit and pervasive in older plants. |\n| **2. SSO Hardening** | Enforce FIDO2 keys, disable password-based SSO, implement contextual access controls (e.g., Okta FastPass). | FortiCloud/Okta bypasses are the #1 identity vector. |\n| **3. OT/IT Convergence Audits** | Map all IT-OT connections; validate firewall rules and log integrity. | Sandworm used VMware to pivot to grid—Materials plants have similar paths. |\n| **4. Developer Environment Security** | Scan VS Code/PyPI extensions for malicious code; isolate R&D VMs from production networks. | Code theft directly impacts IP in materials innovation. |\n| **5. Supply Chain Intelligence** | Monitor dark web for Okta/Crunchbase data leaks; validate supplier security postures. | ShinyHunters’ campaigns show attackers are mapping supplier ecosystems. |\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:** Materials Sector Threat Intelligence Team  \n**Distribution:** CISOs, OT Security Leads, Supply Chain Risk Managers  \n**Next Update:** March 2026  \n**Sources:** The Hacker News, SecurityWeek, BleepingComputer, Security Affairs, Trend Micro, Palo Alto Networks (Jan 22–26, 2026)  \n\n*Note: This assessment filters all provided articles for Materials-sector relevance using industry tags, technical context, and supply chain dependencies.
