  "summary": "**CYBERSECURITY THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT – MATERIALS SECTOR**  \n*Coverage period: 30 days ( 2025‑12‑01 through 2026‑01‑01 )*  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe Materials sector – encompassing mining, metals, chemicals, bulk‑commodity processing, and the supporting industrial‑automation environment – faced a **convergence of OT‑focused ransomware, actively‑exploited supply‑chain vulnerabilities, and a wave of high‑severity software flaws** during the last month.  \n\n* **Ransomware on critical infrastructure** – The most consequential incident was the **large‑scale ransomware attack on Romania’s Oltenia Energy Complex**, a hydro‑electric and thermal generation facility that supplies power to downstream metal‑smelting and chemical plants. The breach forced an emergency shutdown of several turbines, highlighted the sector’s reliance on legacy OT networks, and demonstrated that threat actors are now targeting energy‑production assets that are tightly coupled to raw‑material supply chains.  \n\n* **Industrial‑automation threat landscape** – The Securelist “**Industrial Threat Report – Q3 2025**” identified a **sharp rise (≈ +42 %) in credential‑theft and remote‑code‑execution attacks against PLC/SCADA environments**. The report cites a repeat of the “**Evasive Panda**” DNS‑poisoning campaign delivering the **MgBot** loader, which is now being observed in the supply‑chain of industrial‑control‑system (ICS) firmware updates.  \n\n* **Cross‑sector software exploits** – Three CVEs dominated the week‑long exploitation window and are directly relevant to Materials‑industry IT/OT convergence:  \n\n  1. **CVE‑2025‑14847 (MongoDB “MongoBleed”)** – active exploitation, remote memory‑read leading to credential leakage; 87 k MongoDB instances worldwide (including many ERP/SCADA data‑stores).  \n  2. **FortiOS SSL‑VPN 2FA‑bypass (CVE‑2024‑??? – publicly disclosed 2025‑12‑25)** – active exploitation by ransomware‑as‑a‑service (RaaS) kits; many Materials firms rely on FortiGate for remote plant access.  \n  3. **Digiever NVR RCE (CVE‑2025‑??? – flagged 2025‑12‑25)** – exploited to gain footholds in video‑surveillance networks that protect mines and processing plants.  \n\nThese technical threats **flatten sector boundaries**: any Materials organization that runs standard enterprise stacks (MongoDB, VPN, video surveillance) is exposed, and the OT‑focused ransomware shows that attackers are now **bridging IT‑OT gaps** to achieve higher impact.\n\n**Strategic implication:**  The Materials sector must treat the **IT‑OT interface as the highest‑risk attack surface**, harden remote‑access pathways, and prioritize patching of widely‑used third‑party components (MongoDB, FortiOS, NVR firmware). Failure to do so will continue to enable ransomware extortion, data exfiltration, and operational shutdowns that can ripple through global supply chains for steel, aluminum, chemicals, and construction materials.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Group | Known Motive / Attribution | Materials‑Relevant Activity | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) |\n|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| **Evasive Panda (China‑linked APT)** | State‑sponsored espionage, economic‑theft | DNS‑poisoning campaign delivering **MgBot** loader; observed in firmware‑update servers used by PLC vendors. | • DNS hijacking (T1568)  • Loader deployment (T1105)  • Persistence via malicious firmware signatures |\n| **Mustang Panda / HoneyMyte (APT)** | Chinese‑linked, focus on espionage & intellectual‑property theft | Deploys **ToneShell** kernel‑mode rootkits; capable of subverting Windows‑based HMI/SCADA workstations. | • Signed driver abuse (T1547.001)  • Kernel‑mode backdoor (T1068) |\n| **Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS) operators** (unnamed) | Financial gain, targeting high‑value OT | **Oltenia Energy Complex** ransomware (likely Cl0p/LockBit variant) – leveraged compromised VPN credentials to pivot into plant network. | • Credential dumping (T1003)  • Lateral movement via VPN (T1021.004)  • Data encryption & extortion (T1486) |\n| **Botnet “RondoDox”** | Financially motivated, IoT‑focused | Exploits **React2Shell** flaw to hijack IoT devices used for sensor data collection in mining sites. | • Exploit public-facing application (T1190)  • Botnet C2 (T1071.001) |\n| **Supply‑chain attackers (npm/Node.js)** | Opportunistic, crypto‑focused | Malicious npm packages (e.g., *lotusbail*, *EmEditor* supply‑chain) used to inject miners into build pipelines of Materials‑software vendors. | • Dependency confusion (T1195)  • Credential harvesting (T1566) |\n\n**Key observations**\n\n* The **APT‑style actors** are moving from pure espionage to **dual‑use** tactics that facilitate ransomware (e.g., planting backdoors that later enable extortion).  \n* **Ransomware groups** are increasingly exploiting **VPN and remote‑access misconfigurations** – a known weak point in plant environments where engineers need off‑site access.  \n* **Supply‑chain compromises** in open‑source ecosystems (npm) are a **cross‑industry vector** that can affect Materials‑sector software development pipelines, especially for custom MES/ERP solutions.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
