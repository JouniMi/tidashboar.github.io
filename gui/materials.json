  "summary": "**Materials Sector Cyber Threat Assessment**  \n**Reporting Period:** 30 Days (January 1–31, 2026)  \n**Prepared by:** Cybersecurity Intelligence Division – Materials Sector Practice  \n**Date:** January 15, 2026  \n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nOver the past 30 days, the Materials sector has faced heightened exposure to **cross-industry supply chain compromises**, **industrial control system (ICS)-adjacent targeting**, and **operational technology (OT)–converged infrastructure attacks**—though direct sector attribution remains limited in public reporting. While most high-profile incidents involve healthcare, finance, or critical infrastructure (e.g., energy, ports), several developments directly impact Materials producers, processors, and distributors. Notably, the **Endesa breach** (January 12–13) and the **Dutch port hacker sentencing** (January 12–13) signal a strategic shift toward targeting **industrial logistics and utility-integrated operations**, which are foundational to Materials supply chains. Additionally, the **n8n supply chain attack** (January 12) and **VoidLink Linux malware** (January 13–14) pose significant risks to Materials firms relying on automation, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-native OT/IT integrations.\n\nThe sector’s greatest vulnerability lies in **third-party software dependencies** (e.g., SAP, ServiceNow, n8n), **legacy SCADA/DCS systems**, and **global logistics networks**—all highlighted in recent incidents. APT28’s targeting of “energy research and defense collaboration entities” (January 12) is highly relevant: many Materials R&D labs operate in dual-use contexts (e.g., advanced alloys for aerospace, battery chemistries for defense), making them attractive targets for IP theft and supply chain intelligence. While no Materials company was named in breach disclosures, the **convergence of energy, logistics, and advanced manufacturing** creates implicit exposure. The WEF’s finding that *cyber fraud now surpasses ransomware as the top CEO concern* (January 13) further underscores the threat of business email compromise (BEC) and supply chain fraud—both high-impact vectors for Materials firms managing multi-million-dollar commodity contracts.\n\n---\n\n## Threat Actor Intelligence\n\n### APT Groups with Materials-Relevant Targets\n- **APT28 (Fancy Bear / Sofacy / Strontium)**:  \n  - Targeted “energy research, defense collaboration entities” (January 12).  \n  - Employed **credential-harvesting via PDF-based lures** (e.g., BlueDelta variant) to steal login credentials in under 2 seconds (January 12).  \n  - *Materials relevance*: Advanced materials R&D (e.g., rare-earth magnets, composite ceramics) is frequently co-located with defense/energy labs. IP theft could enable foreign state-backed replication of high-value alloys or battery components.\n\n- **SHADOW-AETHER-015 & Earth Preta**:  \n  - Featured in MITRE ATT&CK Evaluation (Trend Micro, January 13), demonstrating advanced persistence, lateral movement, and anti-analysis techniques.  \n  - *Materials relevance*: These groups favor targeting industrial environments via compromised remote access tools (RATs) and misconfigured cloud workloads—common in Materials plants using IIoT and MES systems.\n\n### Cybercrime Groups with Supply Chain Impact\n- **Black Axe (Nigerian syndicate)**:  \n  - Disrupted via Europol/Spanish police raids (January 11–12), targeting financial services and online dating—but with known expansion into **business email compromise (BEC) and supply chain fraud**.  \n  - *Materials relevance*: BEC attacks on procurement departments could redirect payments for raw material shipments (e.g., nickel, lithium, steel billets), causing financial and operational disruption.\n\n- **DeadLock Ransomware**:  \n  - Uses **blockchain smart contracts to obfuscate data exfiltration and ransom demands** (January 14).  \n  - *Materials relevance*: High-value commodity trading and inventory management systems are prime targets; encryption of ERP data (e.g., SAP S/4HANA) could halt production lines.\n\n### Logistics & Port Operators (Critical Enablers)\n- **Dutch port hacker (sentenced to 7 years, January 12)**:  \n  - Breached port networks to facilitate **coke/smuggling operations**—a direct threat to Materials logistics (e.g., coal, iron ore, scrap metal).  \n  - *Materials relevance*: Port cyber intrusions disrupt bulk shipping schedules, causing cascading delays in raw material delivery and inventory bottlenecks.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Threat Analysis\n\n### Critical Vulnerabilities with Materials Impact\n| Vulnerability | CVE | Affected Tech | Materials Relevance |\n|---------------|-----|---------------|---------------------|\n| **Gogs RCE** | CVE-2025-47004 | Git hosting (self-managed) | High: Used in internal DevOps for custom automation scripts (e.g., process optimization, quality control). CISA added to KEV catalog (Jan 12–13). |\n| **n8n Supply Chain** | CVE-2025-XXXX (unconfirmed) | Workflow automation (n8n) | Critical: n8n is widely adopted in Materials plants for OT-IT integration (e.g., sensor data → ERP).
