  "summary": "**Materials Sector Cyber Threat Assessment**  \n**Reporting Period:** 22–26 January 2026  \n**Prepared by:** Cybersecurity Intelligence Division – Materials Sector Practice  \n\n---\n\n### **Executive Summary**\n\nOver the past 30 days, the Materials sector has been exposed to a confluence of high-impact, cross-industry threats—primarily targeting operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS), supply chain infrastructure, and critical enterprise software used in manufacturing, chemical production, and metal refining environments. While many recent cybersecurity incidents affect broad sectors, several stand out for their direct relevance to Materials: the **Sandworm-linked wiper attack on Poland’s power grid** (repeatedly cited across 7+ sources), the **DynoWiper malware deployment targeting energy infrastructure**, and the **multi-stage phishing campaign explicitly targeting the energy sector using SharePoint**—all of which have direct implications for Materials organizations reliant on grid-powered facilities and integrated OT/IT systems.\n\nA critical pattern emerging is the **weaponization of legacy protocols and unpatched enterprise software**—notably the 11-year-old GNU InetUtils telnetd flaw (CVE-2026-24061), actively exploited to gain root access across exposed systems, and the persistent FortiGate FortiCloud SSO bypass (CVE-2026-20045 and related flaws), now confirmed to affect *fully patched* devices. These vulnerabilities are especially dangerous in Materials environments where older SCADA systems, remote maintenance terminals, and network perimeter devices often remain internet-facing or poorly segmented. Additionally, the **Pwn2Own Automotive 2026 event**—where 76 zero-days were disclosed, including exploits for infotainment and EV charging systems—signals heightened risk for Materials firms involved in automotive supply chains or producing components for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing.\n\nStrategically, the sector faces elevated risk from **APT activity focused on energy and critical infrastructure**, with Russian-linked groups (Sandworm, Konni) demonstrating increasing sophistication in AI-assisted malware development and supply chain compromise. The convergence of ransomware (Osiris), wiper malware (DynoWiper), and credential theft (ShinyHunters’ Okta/SSO campaigns) creates a high-consequence threat landscape where disruption of production, data exfiltration, and physical system damage are no longer theoretical.\n\n---\n\n### **Threat Actor Intelligence**\n\n| Actor | Affiliation | Targeting Pattern | Relevance to Materials |\n|-------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| **Sandworm (APT28)** | Russia (GRU-linked) | Energy, power grid, critical infrastructure | **High**: Confirmed in attempted wiper attack on Polish power grid (DynoWiper); Materials facilities with direct grid interdependence are at elevated risk of sabotage or disruption. |\n| **Konni (Fancy Bear)** | Russia | Blockchain engineers, developers, energy sector | **Medium-High**: Deployed AI-generated PowerShell backdoors and malware targeting technical staff; Materials R&D and engineering teams using custom DevOps pipelines are vulnerable to supply chain injection. |\n| **ShinyHunters** | Cybercrime / APT-adjacent | SSO platforms (Okta, Microsoft), cloud identity, enterprise SaaS | **High**: Claimed breaches of Okta-linked accounts across multiple orgs; Materials firms using centralized identity management (e.g., Okta + Fortinet FortiGate) face credential theft leading to lateral movement into OT environments. |\n| **Unknown (Automated FortiGate attackers)** | Opportunistic / APT tooling repurposed | Fortinet FortiGate firewalls via FortiCloud SSO | **Critical**: Automated campaigns altering firewall rules and stealing configs—directly compromises network segmentation, enabling access to OT/ICS subnets. |\n\n**Supply Chain Risks:**  \n- **VS Code AI Extensions (1.5M installs)**: Malicious extensions (e.g., “AI-powered” tools) stealing source code—threatens proprietary Materials formulations, process automation code, and CAD/CAE models.  \n- **npm/Git dependency bypass (Shai-Hulud flaw)**: Enables supply chain compromise in CI/CD pipelines; Materials firms using DevOps for simulation software (e.g., ANSYS, COMSOL integrations) are at risk of injecting malicious code into engineering tools.  \n- **Pwn2Own Automotive exploits**: EV battery management systems (BMS), infotainment, and charging infrastructure vulnerabilities— Materials suppliers to OEMs (e.g., cathode producers, battery cell manufacturers) may be targeted as entry points into automotive supply chains.\n\n---\n\n### **Technical Threat Analysis**\n\n#### **Critical Vulnerabilities Actively Exploited in Materials-Relevant Environments**\n| CVE | Product | Exploitation Status | Materials Sector Impact |\n|-----|---------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| **CVE-2026-24061** | GNU InetUtils telnetd | Actively exploited (11-year-old flaw) | **Critical**: Telnet remains in use on legacy OT controllers, lab equipment, and remote monitoring systems. Root access enables full system compromise and persistence. |\n| **CVE-2026-20045** | Cisco Unified CM / Webex | Actively exploited; CISA KEV-listed | **High**: Used for credential theft and lateral movement; Materials firms with Cisco-based contact centers or unified communications in corporate OT-adjacent networks are exposed. |\n| **FortiGate FortiCloud SSO Bypass** | Fortinet FortiGate (multiple CVEs) | Actively exploited *even after patching* (Fortinet confirmed) | **Critical**: Enables silent config theft and firewall rule manipulation—allows attackers to disable network segmentation between IT and OT, facilitating OT access. |\n| **CVE-2024-37079** | VMware vCenter Server | Actively exploited; KEV-listed | **High**: Used for VM escape and lateral movement; Materials firms using VMware for virtualized engineering workstations or simulation clusters are at risk. |\n\n#### **Malware Families & Attack Vectors**\n- **DynoWiper**: Wiper malware deployed in attempted Sandworm attack on Polish power grid. Capable of destructive data wiping and system corruption—**high relevance to Materials facilities with grid-tied operations**.\n- **Osiris Ransomware**: New strain using **Bring-Your-Own-Volume-Driver (BYOVD)** to disable security tools. Targets industrial environments; Materials production lines with endpoint protection gaps are vulnerable.\n- **Stanley Phishing Toolkit ($6,000)**: Sold on Russian forums; enables URL spoofing in Chrome to steal credentials. Used in SharePoint-based phishing campaigns targeting energy sector—Materials firms with SharePoint-based document management (e.g., for SOPs, batch records) are prime targets.\n- **Amatera Stealer**: Delivered via fake CAPTCHA scams using Microsoft tools (e.g., Teams, OneDrive). Targets engineering and procurement teams with access to supplier portals and material specifications.\n\n#### **Attack Surface Expansion**\n- **Legacy Protocol Exposure**: 790K+ Telnet servers exposed globally; Materials firms with unsegmented OT networks using telnet for device management are at severe risk.\n- **SSO/Identity Compromise**: Okta SSO vishing and ShinyHunters’ credential theft campaigns enable lateral movement into environments where privileged access controls are weak—common in hybrid IT/OT deployments.\n- **Developer Tool Compromise**: Malicious VS Code extensions (1.5M installs) stealing source code—Materials R&D teams using AI-assisted coding tools are vulnerable to IP theft.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Intelligence**\n\n#### **Sub-Sector Risk Assessment**\n| Sub-Sector | Key Risks | High-Impact Incident Example |\n|------------|-----------|------------------------------|\n| **Chemical & Petrochemical** | OT network exposure, legacy SCADA, supply chain targeting | DynoWiper attack on energy grid—chemical plants require uninterrupted power; disruption could trigger runaway reactions or safety system failure. |\n| **Metals & Mining** | Remote site connectivity, telnet use, vendor access | FortiGate SSO bypass enabling attackers to pivot from corporate network to mine control systems (e.g., conveyor automation, ventilation). |\n| **Advanced Materials (e.g., composites, semiconductors)** | IP theft via DevOps, AI-assisted malware targeting engineers | VS Code extension theft of proprietary material synthesis code; Konni’s AI-generated malware evading detection in R&D environments. |\n| **Construction Materials & Cement** | Supply chain phishing, SmarterMail exploitation | SmarterMail auth bypass used for admin access—threatens procurement systems and logistics coordination. |\n\n#### **Lessons Learned & Incident Response Insights**\n- **Network Segmentation is Non-Negotiable**: The FortiGate SSO bypass attacks demonstrate that perimeter security alone is insufficient. Materials firms must enforce strict IT/OT segmentation—even with patched firewalls, attackers can manipulate rules to bypass controls.\n- **Legacy Protocol Remediation is Urgent**: Telnet remains widespread in OT environments. Immediate action: disable telnet, replace with SSH, and scan for exposed devices (e.g., via CISA’s ICS scanning tools).\n- **Identity Governance Must Extend to OT**: Okta/SSO compromises show that identity theft is a vector into OT. Materials firms should implement just-in-time access, device health checks, and MFA enforcement—even for OT service accounts.\n- **Ransomware/Wiper Resilience Requires Air-Gapped Backups**: Osiris and DynoWiper target security tools and backups. Materials organizations must validate offline backups and test restoration under simulated wiper conditions.\n\n---\n\n### **Forward-Looking Assessment**\n\n#### **Emerging Threats & Trends**\n1. **AI-Driven OT Targeting**: Konni and Sandworm are integrating AI to generate polymorphic malware and evade detection—Materials firms using AI in predictive maintenance or quality control must harden their ML pipelines against poisoning and model theft.\n2. **Automotive Supply Chain Escalation**: Pwn2Own Automotive 2026 exposed 76 zero-days; expect attackers to target Materials suppliers (e.g., battery, sensor, lightweight alloy producers) as low-risk entry points into OEM networks.\n3. **Telnet Resurgence**: Despite being deprecated, CVE-2026-24061’s exploitability and ease of use will drive continued exploitation—especially in low-bandwidth or legacy OT environments common in emerging-market Materials plants.\n4. **Supply Chain Tooling Monetization**: “Stanley”-style phishing kits ($6,000) and AI-powered attack toolkits signal a shift toward accessible, low-skill attack capabilities—Materials firms with weaker security postures (e.g., SME suppliers) face increased phishing and credential theft.\n\n#### **Recommended Defensive Priorities**\n| Priority | Action | Rationale |\n|----------|--------|-----------|\n| **1. OT/IT Segmentation Audit** | Conduct network mapping of IT/OT boundaries; validate firewall rules and micro-segmentation policies. | FortiGate SSO bypass proves perimeter controls can be subverted. |\n| **2. Telnet Elimination Program** | Scan for telnet services in OT environments; deploy SSH; isolate legacy devices. | CVE-2026-24061 is trivial to exploit and widespread. |\n| **3. Identity Hardening for OT Access** | Enforce MFA on all service accounts; implement conditional access for OT resources; monitor Okta/SSO anomalies. | ShinyHunters’ Okta campaigns show identity is the #1 pivot point. |\n| **4. Developer Security Posture Review** | Audit VS Code extensions, npm/Git dependencies, and CI/CD pipelines for supply chain risks. | Malicious AI extensions directly threaten IP in Materials R&D. |\n| **5. Wiper & Ransomware Readiness** | Validate offline backups; test incident response for destructive malware (e.g., DynoWiper, Osiris); deploy endpoint detection with BYOVD detection. | Sandworm’s Polish grid attack demonstrates wiper intent against critical infrastructure. |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The Materials sector is no longer a bystander in cyber conflict. APT activity targeting energy infrastructure, combined with widespread exploitation of legacy vulnerabilities and identity flaws, creates a high-risk environment where operational disruption and IP theft are imminent threats. Proactive hardening of OT/IT convergence points—especially identity management, network segmentation, and legacy protocol hygiene—is now a strategic imperative, not a technical afterthought.  \n\n*— End of Report —*",
