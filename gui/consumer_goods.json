  "summary": "**CONSUMER GOODS CYBERSECURITY THREAT ASSESSMENT**  \n**Reporting Period: 30 Days (January 12 – February 10, 2026)**  \n**Prepared by: Senior Cybersecurity Intelligence Unit – Consumer Goods Sector**  \n**Classification: INTERNAL USE ONLY**\n\n---\n\n## **Executive Summary**\n\nOver the past 30 days, the Consumer Goods sector has faced a heightened and evolving threat landscape characterized by **supply chain compromises, AI-augmented phishing, and targeted credential theft campaigns**, with increasing convergence between cybercrime and geopolitical threat actors. While many reported incidents involve adjacent sectors (e.g., finance, healthcare, tech infrastructure), several high-impact events directly affect Consumer Goods—most notably the **Ingram Micro ransomware attack**, which exposed 42,000+ staff and customer records, and the **Everest ransomware group’s claimed breach of McDonald’s India**, implicating global QSR supply chains. Critically, the sector remains vulnerable due to its reliance on third-party logistics, contract manufacturers, and retail technology platforms—making supply chain infiltration the dominant vector.\n\nA key emerging trend is the **weaponization of AI in both attacks and defense**. Malicious actors are leveraging AI to generate convincing phishing lures (e.g., LastPass impersonation), craft personalized LinkedIn messages for DLL sideloading, and even develop malware (e.g., VoidLink). Simultaneously, AI-powered tools are being used to exploit consumer-facing platforms—such as Google Gemini’s calendar data leak via malicious meeting invites—posing direct risks to consumer data in marketing, loyalty programs, and e-commerce ecosystems. The sector’s high-volume, low-touch customer interactions (e.g., mobile apps, QR codes, event wristbands like Carlsberg’s PII leak) further expand the attack surface for data exfiltration and reputational damage.\n\nStrategically, the most pressing risks include:  \n1. **Third-party vendor risk**, especially among contract manufacturers and distributors (e.g., Ingram Micro);  \n2. **AI-driven social engineering**, targeting both employees and end consumers;  \n3. **Physical-digital convergence**, where IoT-enabled retail assets (e.g., smart shelves, TP-Link cameras in warehouses) become entry points; and  \n4. **Brand impersonation at scale**, facilitated by AI-generated content and compromised support platforms (e.g., Zendesk spam wave).  \n\nOrganizations must prioritize identity-centric security, vendor risk management, and AI-resilient detection systems to mitigate these sector-specific exposures.\n\n---\n\n## **Threat Actor Intelligence**\n\n### **Relevant Threat Actors Targeting Consumer Goods**\nWhile no actor is *exclusively* targeting Consumer Goods, the following groups have demonstrated clear relevance through tactics, targets, or supply chain impact:\n\n- **Everest Ransomware Group**: Claimed breach of **McDonald’s India** (customer data) and stated possession of **Under Armour** data—both major consumer brands. Everest’s targeting of retail/QSR supply chains (e.g., via compromised POS or ERP systems) signals a strategic shift toward high-value consumer brands.  \n- **KongTuke (formerly ClickFix group)**: Deployed **CrashFix**—a fake Chrome ad blocker extension that crashes browsers to trick users into installing **ModeloRAT**. This campaign is highly scalable and effective against retail employees using public kiosks, warehouse devices, or point-of-sale terminals.  \n- **SolyxImmortal**: A newly emerged information stealer with capabilities to harvest credentials, crypto wallets, and browser data—directly applicable to stealing employee and customer credentials across e-commerce and loyalty platforms.  \n- **Access Brokers (e.g., Jordanian national pleading guilty)**: Sold access to **50+ enterprise networks**, including sectors like retail, manufacturing, and professional services—indicating broad availability of compromised credentials on dark web markets, directly enabling ransomware and data theft in Consumer Goods.\n\n### **Supply Chain Risks**\n- **Ingram Micro Ransomware Attack (Jan 19)**: A critical case study. As one of the world’s largest IT distributors, the breach exposed **42,000+ individuals’ data**, including employee and vendor records. This demonstrates how a single distributor compromise can cascade across hundreds of downstream retailers, food & beverage brands, and electronics manufacturers relying on its logistics and billing systems.  \n- **PDFSIDER Malware Deployment on Fortune 100 Firm**: Used DLL side-loading to evade EDR—highly relevant to Consumer Goods firms using legacy ERP or supply chain management software (e.g., SAP, Oracle) vulnerable to such techniques.  \n- **Third-Party App Risk**: Research shows **64% of third-party applications access sensitive data without authorization**—a critical exposure for Consumer Goods companies using marketing automation (e.g., Salesforce apps), retail analytics, or IoT vendor dashboards.\n\n---\n\n## **Technical Threat Analysis**\n\n### **Malware & Exploitation Techniques**\n| Malware/Tool | Relevance to Consumer Goods | Attack Vector |\n|--------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| **PDFSIDER** | APT-grade backdoor used by ransomware groups;
