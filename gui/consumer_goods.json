Secure AI/ML Infrastructure** | Audit all exposed LLM endpoints (Ollama, Hugging Face); implement model integrity checks; restrict external access to AI training pipelines | Prevents LLMjacking, model poisoning, and synthetic media attacks on brand reputation |\n| **2. Strengthen Identity Resilience** | Enforce FIDO2 keys for SSO admin accounts; implement session timeout policies; deploy MFA bypass detection (e.g., Mandiant’s vishing indicators) | Mitigates ShinyHunters-style SSO abuse and credential theft |\n| **3. Third-Party Software Integrity Program** | Require vendors to provide SBOMs for critical tools (AV, ERP, MDM); validate update server integrity; isolate development/test environments | Prevents supply chain compromises like eScan and Open VSX |\n| **4. Mobile App & Packaging Security** | Scan consumer-facing apps for code injection; implement certificate pinning; monitor for fake app clones on third-party stores | Counters Arsink, Phantom Malware, and fake shopping apps |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The Consumer Goods sector is entering a phase where *digital trust* is as critical as product quality. Attackers are no longer just targeting financial data—they are weaponizing AI, supply chains, and mobile ecosystems to erode brand equity at scale. Proactive investment in AI governance, identity resilience, and third-party risk management is no longer optional—it is existential.\n\n*— Prepared by Consumer Goods Cyber Threat Intelligence Unit | 3 February 2026*",
