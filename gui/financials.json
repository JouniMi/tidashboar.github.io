  "summary": "**CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT – FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR**  \n*Coverage window: 30 days (22 Dec 2024 – 31 Dec 2025)*  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been unusually active for the financial services ecosystem.  Threat actors are exploiting a blend of **credential‑theft supply‑chain compromises, ransomware‑as‑a‑service, and sophisticated social‑engineering campaigns that leverage AI‑generated deepfakes**.  The most visible trends are:\n\n| Trend | What we saw | Why it matters to finance |\n|-------|-------------|---------------------------|\n| **Targeted ATM & POS malware** | “Ploutus” ATM‑malware arrests (54 charges) – *SecurityWeek* (12 Dec 2025) | Direct loss of cash, breach of PCI‑DSS compliance, reputational damage for banks and retailers. |\n| **Bank‑account takeover (BAT) platforms** | DOJ seizure of a fraud domain used in a $14.6 M BAT scheme (*The Hacker News*, 23 Dec 2025); FBI seizure of a domain storing stolen bank credentials (*BleepingComputer*, 13 Dec 2025) | Shows that underground marketplaces are actively harvesting and monetising compromised banking credentials. |\n| **AI‑driven investment & crypto scams** | SEC charges over a $14 M AI‑themed crypto‑investment scam (*The Hacker News*, 24 Dec 2025); Nomani deep‑fake investment ads (*The Hacker News*, 13 Dec 2025) | AI‑generated content lowers the barrier for convincing fraud, expanding the attack surface for wealth‑management firms, crypto exchanges, and retail investors. |\n| **Supply‑chain attacks on crypto wallets** | Shai‑Hulud supply‑chain compromise of Trust Wallet (≈$8.5 M loss) (*SecurityWeek*, 31 Dec 2025) | Demonstrates that even “trusted” mobile wallet ecosystems can be weaponised, threatening custodial services and institutional crypto holdings. |\n| **Credential‑stealing npm/WhatsApp packages** | Malicious npm packages stealing WhatsApp tokens (multiple reports, 22‑27 Dec 2025) | Developers in fintech often rely on open‑source npm modules; compromised packages become a vector for exfiltrating MFA tokens and session cookies. |\n| **Insider‑payment fraud** | Report on insiders being paid to bypass security in banking/finance (*HackRead*, 22 Dec 2025) | Highlights the persistent human‑risk factor; insider collusion can accelerate lateral movement and data exfiltration. |\n| **Ransomware pressure on critical banking infrastructure** | Cyber‑attack on France’s postal service that also disrupted digital banking (*SecurityWeek*, 23 Dec 2025) | Shows that ransomware groups are targeting the “bank‑as‑a‑service” layer (payment gateways, digital‑banking portals) to force high‑value ransoms. |\n\n**Strategic implication:**  Financial institutions must treat **credential‑theft supply‑chain vectors and AI‑enabled social engineering as primary entry points**, while also hardening ATM/POS environments and monitoring crypto‑wallet ecosystems for malicious updates.  The convergence of **old‑school credential theft** with **new‑wave AI‑driven fraud** creates a “double‑edged” threat landscape that demands both traditional perimeter controls and advanced behavioural analytics.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Group | Relevant Activity (Financials) | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) | Attribution / Motivation |\n|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Ploutus ransomware/ATM‑malware gang** | 54 arrests for deploying “Ploutus” malware on ATMs (SecurityWeek, 12 Dec 2025). | • Malware injection into ATM firmware via USB/remote admin tools.<br>• Use of custom RAT for persistence.<br>• Cash‑dispensing commands to steal funds. | Financially motivated cyber‑crime syndicate; likely Eastern‑European origin. |\n| **Nefilim ransomware affiliates** (Ukrainian affiliates) – multiple guilty pleas (SecurityWeek, 22 Dec 2025). | While not directly targeting banks in the articles, the affiliate model shows **ransomware‑as‑a‑service** that can be re‑tasked against financial firms. | • Phishing + exploit kits → lateral movement.<br>• Double‑extortion (data leak + ransom). | Profit‑driven; leveraging affiliate networks to broaden victim pool. |\n| **Shai‑Hulud (Supply‑chain) / Trust Wallet** (SecurityWeek, 31 Dec 2025) | Compromise of a third‑party library used by Trust Wallet, resulting in $8.5 M theft. | • Injection of malicious code into npm package.<br>• Credential harvesting of private keys.<br>• Use of obfuscated loaders to evade AV. | Likely financially motivated, possibly state‑tolerated actors targeting crypto ecosystems. |\n| **APT “Evasive Panda” (China‑linked)** (Securelist, 24 Dec 2025) | DNS‑poisoning campaign delivering MgBot – not finance‑specific but the technique can be repurposed to hijack banking DNS (e.g., for credential phishing). | • DNS cache poisoning.<br>• Delivery of modular botnet. | Strategic espionage, but technique transferable to financial services. |\n| **Underground BAT marketplaces** (DoJ & FBI seizures – 23 Dec 2025, 13 Dec 2025) | Platforms selling stolen banking credentials, facilitating $14.6 M fraud. | • Credential dumping via banking trojans.<br>• Sale of “ready‑to‑use” login bundles.<br>• Use of encrypted communication channels. | Purely profit‑driven cyber‑crime economy. |\n| **AI‑deepfake fraud operators** (SEC & The Hacker News, 24 Dec 2025; Nomani scam, 13 Dec 2025) | Fake AI‑generated investment advice, deep‑fake videos, and social‑media ads. | • Synthetic media creation.<br>• Social‑engineering via “trusted” influencers.<br>• Payment redirection to crypto wallets. | Financial fraud, leveraging AI to increase credibility. |\n| **Insider collusion networks** (HackRead, 22 Dec 2025) | Hackers paying insiders in banking/finance to bypass security controls. | • Bribery, black‑mail, credential sharing.<br>• Use of insider knowledge to disable MFA, exfiltrate data. | Financial gain; insider threat amplification. |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risks:**  \n- **npm / open‑source libraries** (malicious WhatsApp API, “lotusbail”, “lotus‑bail”, “Fake WhatsApp API”) – widely used by fintech dev teams.  \n- **Third‑party mobile‑wallet SDKs** (Trust Wallet, other crypto SDKs) – compromised code can directly steal private keys.  \n- **Enterprise SaaS platforms** (n8n workflow automation, MongoDB, Red Hat) – high‑severity CVEs (e.g., CVE‑2025‑14847, n8n CVSS 9.9) could be leveraged to pivot into financial back‑ends.\n\n---\n\n### 3.
