  "summary": "**Financial Services Threat Intelligence Report – 30 Day Window ( 2025‑12‑06 – 2026‑01‑08 )**  \n*Prepared by: Cyber‑Sec Analyst – Financials*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\n**Overall Landscape** – The past month has been defined by a *convergence of three high‑impact trends* that disproportionately affect banks, payment processors, crypto‑exchanges, and custodial wallet providers:\n\n| Trend | Why it matters to Financials | Representative incidents (date) |\n|-------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Supply‑chain compromise of third‑party data & software** | Financial institutions rely on a dense ecosystem of SaaS, cloud, and development‑tool vendors. Breaches of a single upstream provider (e.g., Global‑e, npm, VS Code extension marketplaces) instantly expose millions of customer records and credentials. | • Ledger‑Global‑e data breach (2026‑01‑05 / 06)  • NodeCordRAT hidden in Bitcoin‑themed npm packages (2026‑01‑08)  • VS Code “recommended‑extension” attacks (2026‑01‑05) |\n| **Rapid exploitation of high‑severity CVEs** | CISA’s KEV catalog grew by 20 % in 2025 (1 480 entries). Financial services are repeatedly hit by actively‑exploited flaws in core infrastructure (HPE OneView, Microsoft Office, Veeam, n8n, AdonisJS). The short window between public disclosure and active exploitation leaves many firms exposed. | • HPE OneView & Microsoft Office PowerPoint (CISA KEV, 2026‑01‑08)  • n8n CVSS 10.0 RCE (2026‑01‑07)  • Veeam RCE CVSS 9.0 (2026‑01‑07)  • AdonisJS Body‑parser (CVSS 9.2, 2026‑01‑06) |\n| **Targeted attacks on crypto‑related assets & credential‑theft campaigns** | Crypto exchanges, custodial wallets and fintech SaaS are high‑value, high‑visibility targets. Criminal groups are leveraging credential‑stealing malware, brute‑force tools, and sophisticated phishing that abuse cloud‑service APIs (Google Cloud → Microsoft 365). | • Bitfinex‑hack mastermind release (2026‑01‑05)  • GoBruteforcer campaign against blockchain projects (2026‑01‑07)  • Phishing campaign abusing Google Cloud to harvest Microsoft 365 logins (2026‑01‑06) |\n\n**Strategic Implications** –  \n* Regulatory pressure is rising (e.g., UK regulator scrutiny of AI‑generated content, GDPR‑style data‑breach notifications for crypto wallets).  \n* The attack surface is expanding beyond traditional perimeter assets to include development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and third‑party SaaS APIs.  \n* Failure to adopt rapid patching, MFA, and zero‑trust controls will continue to drive breach incidents with direct financial loss, reputational damage, and potential sanctions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Group | Primary Targets in Financials | Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTPs) | Notable 30‑day Activity |\n|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Crypto‑crime syndicates (e.g., “Bitfinex‑hack crew”)** | Crypto exchanges, custodial wallets, DeFi platforms | • Large‑scale theft of crypto assets  <br>• Use of custom ransomware/cryptojacking <br>• Obfuscation via mixers & offshore entities | • Early release of Bitfinex‑hack mastermind (2026‑01‑05) – signals ongoing operational capability. |\n| **Credential‑stealing cyber‑criminals (Lapsus$‑style, “Lone hacker with infostealers”)** | Banking portals, Microsoft 365, Google Cloud, SaaS | • Infostealer malware (VVS‑Stealer, Veeam‑related payloads) <br>• Phishing with BSoD‑style lures <br>• Exploitation of mis‑configured email routing | • Phishing campaign abusing Google Cloud to steal Microsoft 365 logins (2026‑01‑06)  <br>• Fake Booking.com BSoD → DCRat in hospitality (spill‑over to finance‑related travel bookings). |\n| **Supply‑chain attackers** (e.g., npm package hijackers, VS Code extension manipulators) | Development teams, fintech SaaS, internal tooling | • Insertion of malicious code into open‑source libraries (NodeCordRAT) <br>• “Recommended‑extension” attacks in VS Code forks <br>• Compromise of third‑party data processors (Global‑e) | • NodeCordRAT hidden in Bitcoin‑themed npm packages (2026‑01‑08)  <br>• VS Code “recommended‑extension” supply‑chain risk (2026‑01‑05)  <br>• Ledger‑Global‑e breach exposing wallet customers (2026‑01‑05/06). |\n| **State‑aligned APTs** (e.g., Russia‑linked groups using Viber, Ukraine‑focused ops) | Government‑related finance, critical‑infrastructure finance (e.g., sovereign wealth funds) | • Use of legitimate communications apps for C2 (Viber) <br>• Targeted spear‑phishing, domain‑spoofing | No direct public incident in the 30‑day window, but the *techniques* (Viber C2, email‑routing abuse) are being repurposed by financially‑motivated actors. |\n| **Bot‑traffic abuse groups** | Online banking portals, payment gateways | • Legitimate‑bot traffic to hide credential‑stuffing <br>• Use of residential proxy networks (Kimwolf) for large‑scale credential harvesting | • Legitimate bot traffic identified as a blind spot (2026‑01‑07) – includes financial services. |\n\n**Supply‑Chain Risk Assessment** – The Ledger‑Global‑e breach demonstrates that a *single third‑party data‑processor compromise* can expose millions of crypto‑wallet users. The npm/NodeCordRAT and VS Code extension attacks show that *development‑tool supply chains* are now a primary attack vector for financial‑software vendors.  \n\n---\n\n## 3.
