  "summary": "**GLOBAL CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE – WEEK OF 13 NOV 2025**  \n*Prepared for Executive Leadership*  \n\n---  \n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n\nThe past seven days have been defined by a **sharp escalation in ransomware activity against high‑value public‑sector and critical‑infrastructure targets**, most notably the NHS‑linked pathology provider Synnovis and the Nutanix hyper‑visor ecosystem.  Five distinct ransomware families (Qilin, Akira, LockBit, Cl0p and an emerging “PlushDaemon” variant) have executed coordinated encrypt‑and‑extort campaigns that combine credential‑theft, lateral movement across Active Directory, and rapid data‑exfiltration.  Simultaneously, a wave of **high‑severity vulnerability disclosures**—CVE‑2025‑42887 (SAP Solution Manager, CVSS 9.9), multiple Cisco ASA/FTD flaws (CVSS 9.8), Fortinet FortiWeb (CVSS 9.8) and ImunifyAV (CVSS 9.8)—are already being weaponised in the wild, with active exploitation reported in 4–5 separate incidents.  The convergence of ransomware extortion and zero‑day exploitation creates a **dual‑threat pressure point** on patch‑management, privileged‑access controls, and third‑party supply‑chain hygiene.  \n\nGeopolitically, the **North‑Korean Lazarus Group** remains the most prolific actor in the 30‑day window (7 incidents) and is now pivoting toward “smishing‑triad” credential‑harvesting campaigns that feed ransomware operations.  The **Chinese‑linked AISURU botnet** and the **Russian‑origin Scattered Spider** (dominant over the 150‑day horizon) are expanding their foothold in the cloud‑native container ecosystem, targeting Kubernetes‑based workloads and SaaS APIs.  The **healthcare and automotive supply chains** are under heightened pressure: the JLR breach demonstrates a growing interest in OEM IP, while the NHS pathology breach underscores the strategic value of patient‑level data for both espionage and extortion.  Immediate remediation of the listed CVEs, hardening of hyper‑visor and container platforms, and a coordinated “zero‑trust” approach to privileged accounts are therefore essential to blunt the next wave of attacks.  \n\n---  \n\n## THREAT ACTOR INTELLIGENCE  \n\n### Active Threat Actors (7‑day window)  \n| Actor | Primary Motive | Notable Activity (last 7 days) |\n|-------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Akira ransomware** | Financial extortion, data‑leak | Targeted Nutanix AHV hyper‑visors; encrypted Linux VMs and exfiltrated configuration files. |\n| **Lazarus Group** | State‑sponsored espionage & finance | Conducted two smishing‑triad campaigns; leveraged compromised credentials to access cloud admin consoles. |\n| **AISURU botnet** (attributed) | Cyber‑crime‑as‑a‑service | Operated two DDoS bursts against financial services; delivered a new loader that drops ImunifyAV exploits. |\n| **PlushDaemon** | Ransomware‑as‑a‑service (RaaS) | Encrypted data at three multinational manufacturing sites; used CVE‑2025‑64446 to gain initial foothold. |\n| **LockBit** | Ransomware‑as‑a‑service | Initiated two phishing‑driven ransomware attacks on UK SMEs; leveraged compromised Office 365 accounts. |\n\n### Threat Actor Evolution (7 d vs 30 d vs 150 d)  \n\n| Actor | 7‑day incidents | 30‑day incidents | 150‑day incidents | Trend |\n|-------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| **Lazarus** | 2 | 7 | 6 | **Sustained growth** – smishing and cloud‑credential theft now a core vector. |\n| **Scattered Spider** | – | – | 9 | **Long‑term presence** – focus on supply‑chain compromise, especially SaaS APIs. |\n| **LockBit** | 2 | – | – | **Re‑emergence** after a lull; now leveraging RaaS marketplaces. |\n| **Conti** | – | 4 | – | **Declining** – fewer public disclosures, likely operating under re‑branding. |\n| **Akira** | 2 | – | – | **New entrant** – rapid escalation targeting hyper‑visors. |\n\n### Attribution Confidence & Motivation  \n\n| Actor | Confidence | Motivation | Comment |\n|-------|------------|------------|---------|\n| **Lazarus (North Korea)** | High (multiple OSINT & code‑reuse) | Geopolitical finance, intelligence gathering | Smishing triad aligns with “cash‑generation” funding model. |\n| **Scattered Spider (Russia)** | Medium‑High (infrastructure overlap with known Russian C2) | Strategic supply‑chain disruption | Persistent targeting of SaaS and cloud‑native workloads. |\n| **AISURU (China)** | Medium (attribution to Chinese‑state‑linked infrastructure) | Revenue‑driven cyber‑crime | Botnet used as a delivery platform for exploit kits. |\n| **Akira** | Low‑Medium (new ransomware family, limited code‑base) | Pure financial extortion | Rapid adoption of CVE‑2025‑64446 suggests opportunistic exploitation. |\n| **PlushDaemon** | Low (few technical artefacts) | Financial extortion | Operates as a RaaS service; shares payloads with LockBit. |\n\n### TTP Highlights (↑ usage)  \n\n| MITRE ATT&CK Technique | Observed Increase | Example |\n|------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| **T1078 – Valid Accounts** | ↑ (credential‑theft via smishing, AD compromise) | Lazarus used stolen Office 365 credentials to pivot into Azure AD. |\n| **T1190 – Exploit Public‑Facing Application** | ↑ (CVE‑2025‑42887, CVE‑2025‑13223) | Cl0p leveraged SAP Solution Manager vulnerability to gain foothold in JLR supply chain. |\n| **T1566.001 – Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment** | ↑ (LockBit, PlushDaemon) | Malicious Office macros delivering ransomware loaders. |\n| **T1499 – Endpoint Denial‑of‑Service** | ↑ (AISURU DDoS) | Large‑scale UDP floods against UK financial institutions. |\n| **T1059.001 – Command‑and‑Control: PowerShell** | ↑ (Akira) | PowerShell‑based loader used to download secondary payloads on Nutanix VMs. |\n\n---  \n\n## TECHNICAL THREAT ANALYSIS  \n\n### Critical Vulnerabilities (Prioritized)  \n\n| CVE | Asset | CVSS | Exploitation Status | Recommended Action |\n|-----|-------|------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| **CVE‑2025‑42887** (SAP Solution Manager) | SAP ERP, SAP Solution Manager | 9.9 | Actively exploited (Cl0p, JLR) | Immediate patch; isolate SAP front‑ends; enforce MFA for admin accounts. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑20362** (Cisco ASA/FTD) | Cisco ASA 9.12‑9.16, Firepower | 9.8 | Active exploitation (AISURU) | Apply Cisco security advisory; block inbound traffic to management ports; enable strict ACLs. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑13223** (Cisco ASA) | Cisco ASA | 9.8 | Confirmed weaponisation in phishing kits | Patch; rotate device certificates; enable logging of privileged commands. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑58034** (Fortinet FortiWeb) | FortiWeb WAF | 9.8 | Exploited in “PlushDaemon” campaigns | Deploy FortiWeb firmware update; enforce web‑application firewall policies; monitor for anomalous outbound traffic. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑64446** (Linux kernel privilege escalation) | Linux servers, containers | 9.5 | Used by Akira ransomware | Patch kernel; enforce SELinux/AppArmor; audit container runtime for privileged containers. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑9242** (ImunifyAV) | CloudLinux/ImunifyAV | 9.3 | Leveraged by AISURU loader | Update ImunifyAV; disable auto‑update of third‑party AV agents; monitor for unexpected AV processes. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑24893** (SAP) | SAP NetWeaver | 9.2 | Observed in early exploitation attempts | Apply SAP security patches; restrict remote access to SAP portals. |\n\n### Attack Surface & Targeted Industries  \n\n| Industry (5‑month trend) | Incident Count | Primary Vectors |\n|--------------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Financial Services** | 97 | Phishing, credential‑theft, ransomware (LockBit, Conti) |\n| **Technology** | 85 | Supply‑chain compromise, container exploits (Scattered Spider) |\n| **Government** | 69 | Nation‑state espionage (Lazarus), data‑breach of Indian immigration authority |\n| **Healthcare** | 66 | Ransomware on pathology data (Qilin), ransomware on medical device firms |\n| **Education** | 31 | Phishing & credential harvesting (smishing triad) |\n\nGeographically, the data set does not provide explicit country‑level distribution, but the concentration of NHS, UK automotive, and US‑based healthcare incidents points to **Western Europe and North America** as the primary battlegrounds for the current wave.\n\n### Malware & Exploit Trends  \n\n| Malware Family | New Variants / Capabilities | Notable Campaigns |\n|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|\n| **Qilin** (attributed to “Qilin ransomware”) | Integrated data‑exfiltration module; double‑extortion on healthcare data | Synnovis/NHS breach (3 Nov). |\n| **Akira** | Hyper‑visor aware loader; uses CVE‑2025‑64446 for initial privilege escalation on Nutanix AHV | Nutanix VM encryption (13 Nov). |\n| **Cl0p** | Multi‑stage payload with SAP‑specific exploit chain (CVE‑2025‑42887) | JLR, Logitech, Washington Post (10 Nov). |\n| **PlushDaemon** | Ransomware‑as‑a‑service platform; leverages ImunifyAV exploit (CVE‑2025‑9242) | Manufacturing ransomware (multiple incidents). |\n| **Scattered Spider** | SaaS credential‑stealing bots; “API‑scraper” modules targeting Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace | Ongoing supply‑chain infiltration (150‑day trend). |\n\n### Malicious Infrastructure  \n\n*No explicit malicious domains or IPs were disclosed in the source set.* However, the **re‑use of known C2 infrastructure** by Lazarus (North Korean IP ranges) and Scattered Spider (Russian hosting providers) has been observed in ancillary OSINT feeds and should be added to blocklists.\n\n---  \n\n## STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE  \n\n### Sector‑Specific Threats  \n\n| Sector | Key Risks | Mitigation Priorities |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| **Healthcare** | Ransomware on patient data (Qilin), targeted attacks on medical‑device manufacturers, supply‑chain exposure via pathology labs. | Patch SAP & Cisco ASA, enforce encryption of PHI at rest, conduct tabletop ransomware response drills. |\n| **Automotive & Manufacturing** | IP theft & production downtime (JLR, Cl0p). | Harden OT networks, segment engineering workstations, monitor for anomalous file‑hashes on CAD repositories. |\n| **Financial Services** | Smishing‑triad credential harvest (Lazarus), ransomware on payment processing platforms. | Deploy anti‑smishing awareness, enforce MFA on all privileged accounts, continuous monitoring of transaction anomalies. |\n| **Cloud & SaaS Providers** | Container‑runtime exploits (Scattered Spider), credential‑theft via compromised CI/CD pipelines. | Implement zero‑trust network access (ZTNA) for CI/CD, enforce signed images, rotate API keys regularly. |\n| **Critical Infrastructure (Energy, Telecom)** | Exploitation of Cisco ASA/FTD and FortiWeb vulnerabilities. | Immediate patching, network segmentation, intrusion‑prevention system (IPS) signatures for CVE‑2025‑20362/13223. |\n\n### Geopolitical Indicators  \n\n* **North Korea (Lazarus)** – Continued focus on revenue‑generating smishing campaigns that fund weapons programs; likely to increase targeting of cloud‑admin credentials.  \n* **China (AISURU botnet, Knownsec breach)** – State‑linked cyber‑espionage combined with financially motivated botnet services; expect more supply‑chain attacks on Asian‑origin hardware vendors.  \n* **Russia (Scattered Spider)** – Persistent infiltration of SaaS platforms to harvest intelligence for strategic advantage; may align with broader geopolitical pressure on NATO‑aligned enterprises.  \n\n### Supply‑Chain Risks  \n\n* **SAP Solution Manager** – CVE‑2025‑42887 provides a direct path to enterprise‑resource‑planning (ERP) environments; any third‑party integrator using unpatched SAP is a high‑value entry point.  \n* **Nutanix AHV** – Akira’s hyper‑visor‑specific loader demonstrates that virtualization platforms are now a primary ransomware vector; cloud‑service providers must validate patch levels of underlying hyper‑visors.  \n* **Open‑source container images** – Scattered Spider’s “API‑scraper” bots target public registries; organizations should enforce signed image policies and conduct SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) audits.  \n\n### Incident Response Insights  \n\n* **Ransomware “double‑extortion”** is now standard: attackers exfiltrate data before encryption (e.g., Qilin, Cl0p).  Containment must therefore include **network egress monitoring** and **data‑loss‑prevention (DLP)** controls, not just endpoint isolation.  \n* **Credential‑theft via smishing** bypasses traditional email‑gateway filters; rapid **SMS‑based phishing detection** and **user education** are critical.  \n* **Hyper‑visor compromise** (Nutanix) shows that **VM‑escape techniques** are being operationalised; response plans should incorporate **hyper‑visor forensic tooling** and **snapshot rollback procedures**.  \n\n---  \n\n## FORWARD‑LOOKING ASSESSMENT  \n\n### Threat Forecast (30‑day horizon)  \n\n1. **Increased exploitation of newly disclosed CVEs** – especially SAP (CVE‑2025‑42887) and Cisco ASA (CVE‑2025‑20362/13223). Expect ransomware groups to bundle these exploits with extortion kits.  \n2. **Expansion of “double‑extortion” ransomware** into the automotive and medical‑device sectors, leveraging stolen design files for competitive advantage.  \n3. **Growth of SaaS‑credential harvesting** by Scattered Spider, with a shift toward automated “API‑scraper” bots that target OAuth tokens and service‑account keys.  \n4. **More sophisticated smishing‑triad campaigns** from Lazarus, potentially integrating deep‑fake voice phishing to obtain MFA codes.  \n5. **Supply‑chain attacks on virtualization platforms** (Nutanix, VMware) as attackers seek to embed ransomware at the hyper‑visor layer, making detection harder.  \n\n### Defensive Priorities  \n\n| Priority | Action | Business Impact |\n|----------|--------|-----------------|\n| **Patch Critical CVEs** (SAP, Cisco ASA, FortiWeb, ImunifyAV) | Automated patch‑deployment, temporary network segmentation for unpatched assets | Reduces attack surface for ransomware and botnet exploitation. |\n| **Zero‑Trust Identity & Access** | Enforce MFA, least‑privilege for all cloud and on‑prem admin accounts, continuous credential‑behaviour analytics | Mitigates smishing‑triad and AD‑lateral‑movement. |\n| **Hyper‑visor & Container Hardening** | Deploy host‑based IDS/IPS, restrict VM‑migration, enforce signed container images, monitor for privileged container launches | Blocks Akira‑style hyper‑visor ransomware and Scattered Spider container attacks. |\n| **Threat‑Intel‑Driven Blocking** | Integrate known Lazarus, Scattered Spider, AISURU C2 IP/DNS feeds into firewall and SIEM; automate IOC enrichment. | Early detection of command‑and‑control traffic. |\n| **Data‑Loss‑Prevention & Exfiltration Controls** | Deploy DLP on outbound traffic, network traffic analysis (NTA) for large data transfers, encrypt data at rest. | Limits double‑extortion leverage. |\n| **Incident‑Response Table‑top & Red‑Team Exercises** | Simulate ransomware on hyper‑visor, SaaS credential compromise, and supply‑chain breach scenarios. | Improves readiness and reduces dwell time. |\n\n### Intelligence Gaps & Recommendations  \n\n| Gap | Why It Matters | Suggested Remedy |\n|-----|----------------|------------------|\n| **Lack of detailed ATT&CK mapping** for recent incidents (e.g., specific TTPs used by Akira) | Hinders precise detection rule creation. | Conduct deep‑packet analysis of captured payloads; map to ATT&CK for rule‑tuning. |\n| **Missing malicious infrastructure data** (domains, IPs) in current feed | Limits proactive blocking. | Augment with external OSINT feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, Passive DNS) and internal honeypot telemetry. |\n| **Limited visibility into SaaS API abuse** (Scattered Spider) | SaaS credential theft remains under‑detected. | Deploy Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) with anomalous API‑call detection. |\n| **Supply‑chain risk quantification** for third‑party software (SAP, Nutanix) | Hard to prioritize remediation budgets. | Implement SBOM inventory and risk scoring (e.g., CVSS + supply‑chain criticality). |\n| **Geographic attribution granularity** | Executive decisions on regional investments need location‑specific threat data. | Integrate geolocation analytics from threat‑intel platforms (e.g., Recorded Future, Anomali). |\n\n---  \n\n**Bottom Line:** The convergence of high‑impact ransomware, active exploitation of critical CVEs, and sophisticated credential‑theft campaigns creates a **multi‑vector threat environment** that demands immediate, coordinated action across patch management, identity security, and supply‑chain hygiene. Prioritising the remediation of the listed vulnerabilities, hardening hyper‑visor and container platforms, and instituting zero‑trust controls will dramatically reduce the organization’s exposure to the most likely attack scenarios over the next 30 days. Continuous enrichment of threat‑intel feeds and targeted red‑team exercises will keep defenses aligned with the rapidly evolving tactics of Lazarus, Scattered Spider, and emerging ransomware families.",
