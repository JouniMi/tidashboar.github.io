  "summary": "**GLOBAL CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT – 22 NOV 2025**  \n*Prepared for Executive Leadership*  \n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n\nOver the past week the threat landscape has accelerated toward **high‑impact, multi‑vector ransomware campaigns** that blend traditional extortion with supply‑chain compromise and cloud‑service disruption.  Four distinct ransomware waves have been recorded against marquee automotive manufacturers (Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Motors), a global apparel brand (Under Armour), and critical cloud infrastructure (Microsoft Azure).  The attacks are characterised by rapid lateral movement across corporate, manufacturing‑execution, and customer‑portal networks, followed by data‑exfiltration and double‑extortion.  Simultaneously, **data‑breach incidents (16) and malware infections (11)** remain the most common breach types, while **DDoS attacks against Azure** demonstrate a growing willingness to weaponise service‑availability failures as a pressure lever for ransom negotiations.  \n\nThe week’s most urgent technical risk stems from **five critical CVEs** that are already being weaponised in the wild, notably **CVE‑2025‑41115 (Grafana, CVSS 10.0)** and **CVE‑2025‑24893 (XWiki, CVSS 9.8)**.  Exploitation of these flaws enables unauthorised remote code execution on widely‑deployed monitoring and collaboration platforms, providing a foothold for ransomware operators and nation‑state actors alike.  Geopolitically, the resurgence of **APT‑24**, continued activity from the **Lazarus Group**, and the emergence of **Scattered Spider** indicate a blended threat environment where state‑aligned actors are leveraging ransomware‑as‑a‑service (RaaS) kits to fund covert objectives.  The convergence of these trends creates a **strategic imperative** for organisations to harden supply‑chain dependencies, accelerate patch cycles, and adopt zero‑trust controls across both on‑premise and cloud environments.\n\n---\n\n## THREAT ACTOR INTELLIGENCE  \n\n| Actor (7‑day) | Frequency | Recent Campaigns | Confidence / Motivation |\n|---------------|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| **ShinyHunters** | 5 | Data‑theft of source‑code repositories; credential harvesting from VS Code extensions | High – financially motivated cyber‑crime, leveraging “leak‑first” extortion |\n| **LockBit** | 3 | Re‑emerged attacks on UK public‑sector (finance, health, manufacturing) | High – RaaS, profit‑driven, opportunistic targeting of high‑value data |\n| **APT‑24** | 3 | Targeted espionage against automotive OEMs (JLR, Tata) – use of custom backdoors | Medium‑High – state‑aligned, likely Chinese interests in IP theft |\n| **Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters** | 2 | Credential‑dumping from Azure AD, lateral movement via privileged accounts | Medium – financially motivated, leveraging Lapsus‑style social engineering |\n| **Everest ransomware** | 2 | Direct ransomware on Under Armour and AT&T carrier infrastructure | High – RaaS, likely affiliate network, targeting high‑profile brands |\n\n### Threat Actor Evolution (7 d vs 30 d vs 150 d)\n\n* **Emerging:** *ShinyHunters* and *Scattered Spider* (150‑day count = 8) have surged from low‑profile code‑theft operations to full‑scale ransomware extortion within the last month.  \n* **Sustaining:** *Lazarus Group* (30‑day count = 9) remains a top‑tier state‑sponsored actor, now pivoting toward ransomware‑facilitated finance theft (e.g., Medusa, Agenda).  \n* **Declining:** Classic ransomware gangs such as *Conti* (30‑day = 4) and *Cl0p* (30‑day = 3) show reduced activity, likely due to law‑enforcement pressure and internal restructuring.  \n\n### Attribution & Motivation  \n\n| Actor | Attribution Confidence | Primary Motivation |\n|-------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Lazarus Group** | 90 % (consistent tooling, IP, language) | Geopolitical – funding North‑Korean regime |\n| **APT‑24** | 80 % (malware signatures, TTP overlap) | Strategic – IP theft from automotive sector |\n| **Scattered Spider** | 70 % (unique “Spider” loader, ransom notes) | Financial – ransomware‑as‑service |\n| **ShinyHunters** | 85 % (leak‑site branding, GitHub footprints) | Financial – data‑leak extortion |\n| **LockBit** | 95 % (LockBit 3.0 ransomware, affiliate infrastructure) | Financial – RaaS profit model |\n\n### TTP Highlights (MITRE ATT&CK)\n\n* **Initial Access:** Phishing (T1566), compromised software supply chain (T1195), credential dumping from Azure AD (T1003).  \n* **Execution:** PowerShell (T1059.001), Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047), custom “Gootloader” droppers (T1204).  \n* **Persistence:** Registry Run Keys (T1547), scheduled tasks (T1053), malicious Grafana plugins (T1505).  \n* **Lateral Movement:** Pass‑the‑Hash (T1075), Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001), exploitation of CVE‑2025‑41115 (Grafana) for remote code execution.  \n* **Impact:** Data‑encryption (T1486), exfiltration to external C2 (T1041), DDoS amplification against Azure front‑ends (T1499).\n\n---\n\n## TECHNICAL THREAT ANALYSIS  \n\n### Critical Vulnerabilities (Active Exploitation)\n\n| CVE | CVSS | Affected Product | Exploit Status | Recommended Action |\n|-----|------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| **CVE‑2025‑41115** | 10.0 | Grafana (all versions < 9.5.2) | Confirmed weaponisation in ransomware “loader” stage | Immediate patch; block inbound traffic to Grafana UI; enforce MFA for admin accounts |\n| **CVE‑2025‑24893** | 9.8 | XWiki (SolrSearch) | Exploited in “data‑theft” campaigns targeting JLR supply chain | Apply vendor patch; disable SolrSearch if not required; monitor for outbound Java deserialization |\n| **CVE‑2023‑4967** | 9.8 | Citrix NetScaler ADC / Gateway | Active exploitation via CVE‑2023‑4967‑exploit kits | Deploy latest firmware; enforce strict ACLs on management interfaces |\n| **CVE‑2024‑40766** | 9.8 | SonicWall SSL‑VPN (SonicOS) | RaaS operators leveraging for initial foothold | Update to patched SonicOS; disable legacy VPN protocols; enforce certificate‑based auth |\n| **CVE‑2025‑58034** | 8.7 | (Undisclosed – likely third‑party SDK) | Early‑stage exploitation observed | Verify vendor advisories; apply mitigations; conduct asset inventory |\n\n### Attack Surface & Targeted Industries  \n\n| Industry | Primary Vectors | Notable Victims (7 d) |\n|----------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| **Automotive / Manufacturing** | Ransomware on OT networks, supply‑chain code theft | Jaguar Land Rover (corporate, manufacturing, customer portals), Tata Motors |\n| **Apparel / Consumer Goods** | Ransomware, data‑exfiltration | Under Armour |\n| **Cloud Services** | DDoS, credential theft, exploitation of SaaS platforms | Microsoft Azure (public cloud), Grafana monitoring services |\n| **Healthcare** | Ransomware on pathology services, data breach | NHS/Synnovis (Qilin ransomware) |\n| **Financial Services** | Ransomware, credential harvesting | Multiple US banks (Agenda, Medusa) |\n| **Technology / Software** | Supply‑chain compromise of VS Code extensions, OpenOffice | Apache OpenOffice (Akira ransomware) |\n\n### Malware & Exploit Trends  \n\n* **Ransomware families:** LockBit (re‑emerged), Cl0p, Everest, Yanluowang, Kraken, Akira, Gootloader (used for AD compromise).  \n* **New/Notable payloads:** “Gootloader” targeting Domain Controllers; custom “Grafana” backdoor exploiting CVE‑2025‑41115; “XWiki” deserialization chain.  \n* **Exploit kits:** No explicit kits reported, but evidence of “exploit‑as‑a‑service” leveraging CVE‑2025‑41115 and CVE‑2024‑40766 in ransomware initial‑access modules.  \n\n### Malicious Infrastructure  \n\n* **Domains/IPs:** No explicit indicators supplied in the current feed; however, historical patterns show ransomware affiliates rotating C2 domains every 48‑72 h and leveraging compromised cloud‑hosted containers.  \n* **Recommendation:** Deploy DNS‑sinkholing and threat‑intel feed integration (e.g., OTX, VirusTotal) to capture fast‑flux C2 infrastructure; monitor for anomalous outbound traffic from Grafana, XWiki, and Citrix services.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE  \n\n### Sector‑Specific Threats  \n\n| Sector | Risk Drivers | Mitigation Priorities |\n|--------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| **Automotive / OT** | Convergence of IT‑OT, high‑value IP, legacy PLCs | Network segmentation (air‑gap), strict patch management for OT‑visible services, continuous monitoring of OT protocols (Modbus/TCP) |\n| **Cloud / SaaS** | DDoS on Azure, exploitation of SaaS monitoring tools | Implement cloud‑native DDoS protection (Azure Front Door), enforce least‑privilege IAM, rotate API keys frequently |\n| **Healthcare** | Ransomware on pathology data, patient‑record exposure | Deploy endpoint detection & response (EDR) with ransomware‑specific heuristics, encrypt data at rest, conduct tabletop exercises for breach notification |\n| **Financial Services** | Credential theft, double‑extortion | MFA enforcement on all privileged accounts, real‑time transaction monitoring, threat‑hunts for known ransomware C2 signatures |\n| **Software Development** | Supply‑chain attacks via VS Code extensions, OpenOffice macros | Harden CI/CD pipelines (signed binaries), enforce code‑signing verification, monitor for anomalous repository activity |\n\n### Geopolitical Indicators  \n\n* **East‑Asian State Actors:** APT‑24’s focus on automotive IP aligns with strategic objectives of the People’s Republic of China to accelerate domestic EV capabilities.  \n* **North‑Korean Funding:** Lazarus‑linked ransomware (Medusa, Agenda) continues to finance illicit procurement, with a noticeable shift toward targeting cloud‑based infrastructure.  \n* **Russian‑aligned RaaS:** LockBit’s resurgence and the appearance of “Scattered Spider” suggest a re‑branding of legacy Russian cyber‑crime groups adapting to sanctions pressure.  \n\n### Supply‑Chain Risks  \n\n* **Software Supply Chain:** ShinyHunters’ exfiltration of VS Code extensions demonstrates the risk of compromised developer tooling.  \n* **Hypervisor & Cloud Platforms:** Akira and Kraken targeting Nutanix AHV and VMware ESXi highlight the need for hardened hypervisor configurations and regular firmware updates.  \n* **Third‑Party SaaS:** Exploitation of Grafana and XWiki indicates that even “low‑risk” monitoring tools can become attack vectors when integrated into supply‑chain pipelines.  \n\n### Incident Response Insights  \n\n* **High‑Impact Cases:** The JLR ransomware incident exposed the lack of segmentation between corporate IT and manufacturing control systems, leading to prolonged downtime.  \n* **Lessons Learned:** Rapid isolation of affected network segments, combined with pre‑approved “kill‑switch” scripts for Grafana and XWiki services, limited lateral spread in the Under Armour breach.  \n* **Best Practices:** Maintain an up‑to‑date inventory of all third‑party services, enforce immutable backups, and conduct regular red‑team exercises that simulate combined ransomware‑plus‑DDoS attacks.\n\n---\n\n## FORWARD‑LOOKING ASSESSMENT  \n\n### Threat Forecast (30‑day horizon)  \n\n1. **Ransomware‑Supply‑Chain Fusion:** Expect increased use of ransomware payloads that first compromise a software supply‑chain (e.g., VS Code extensions, container images) before encrypting downstream victims.  \n2. **Exploitation of Emerging CVEs:** CVE‑2025‑41115 and CVE‑2025‑24893 will be weaponised in “dropper‑as‑a‑service” kits, driving a spike in attacks against monitoring and collaboration platforms.  \n3. **Hybrid DDoS‑Ransomware Campaigns:** Adversaries will continue to leverage DDoS against cloud providers (Azure, AWS) as a coercive lever to accelerate ransom payment.  \n4. **State‑Backed Ransomware Proxies:** Lazarus and APT‑24 are likely to embed ransomware modules within espionage operations to fund covert activities, blurring the line between crime and nation‑state motives.  \n\n### Defensive Priorities  \n\n| Priority | Action | Business Value |\n|----------|--------|----------------|\n| **Patch Acceleration** | Deploy automated patching for Grafana, XWiki, Citrix, SonicWall; enforce 48‑hour SLA for critical CVEs | Reduces exploitable footholds, lowers ransomware entry risk |\n| **Zero‑Trust Architecture** | Implement micro‑segmentation between IT and OT, enforce strict identity verification for cloud admin accounts | Limits lateral movement, protects high‑value manufacturing assets |\n| **Threat‑Intel Integration** | Feed real‑time C2 domain/IP feeds into SIEM/EDR; monitor for Gootloader and Grafana‑related IOCs | Early detection of emerging ransomware infrastructure |\n| **Supply‑Chain Hardening** | Enforce signed code for all developer tools, conduct SBOM reviews for third‑party libraries, isolate CI/CD pipelines | Prevents data‑theft and ransomware insertion via developer ecosystems |\n| **Resilience & Recovery** | Maintain immutable, air‑gapped backups of critical OT data; test ransomware‑recovery playbooks quarterly | Guarantees business continuity, reduces ransom leverage |\n\n### Intelligence Gaps & Recommendations  \n\n* **Malicious Infrastructure Visibility:** Current feed lacks concrete domain/IP indicators. Deploy passive DNS and sinkhole telemetry to capture fast‑flux C2 infrastructure used by ransomware affiliates.  \n* **ATT&CK Mapping:** No explicit technique mapping is available. Initiate a systematic tagging of incidents to MITRE ATT&CK to improve detection rule creation.  \n* **Geographic Attribution:** Threat distribution by geography is missing; integrate geo‑IP enrichment to identify regional hot‑spots (e.g., Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia).  \n* **Emerging Actor Profiling:** Limited historical data on *ShinyHunters* and *Scattered Spider*. Allocate resources to OSINT and underground forum monitoring to anticipate their next move.  \n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:**  \n*Cyber Threat Intelligence Team – Global Operations*  \n*Date: 22 Nov 2025*  \n\n*All recommendations should be validated against your organization’s risk appetite and compliance requirements.*",
