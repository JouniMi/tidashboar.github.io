  "summary": "**Global Threat Intelligence Brief – 28 Jan 2026**  \n*Prepared for Executive Leadership (C‑Suite & Board)*  \n\n---  \n\n## Executive Summary  \n\nOver the past week the threat landscape has accelerated in both breadth and depth.  Data‑breach incidents ( +16 ) and phishing campaigns ( +15 ) remain the most frequent initial‑access vectors, but the ratio of successful ransomware encryptions has risen sharply ( +6  incidents, +40 % week‑over‑week).  High‑impact compromises of globally‑distributed e‑commerce platforms (Under Armour, McDonald’s India) and critical‑infrastructure operators (Polish power‑grid assets) demonstrate a clear shift toward “high‑value, high‑visibility” targets that can generate both extortion revenue and geopolitical leverage.  At the same time, exploitation of newly disclosed critical vulnerabilities—most notably **CVE‑2025‑52691** (CVSS 10.0) in SmarterMail and **CVE‑2026‑22844** (CVSS 9.9) in Zoom Meeting Connector—has been observed in active ransomware payloads, indicating that threat actors are rapidly weaponising zero‑day or near‑zero‑day flaws to bypass traditional perimeter controls.  \n\nStrategically, the data reveal a convergence of three trends:  \n\n1. **State‑aligned actors (e.g., Sandworm, Lazarus‑linked groups) are increasingly collaborating with cyber‑criminal Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS) platforms**, blurring the line between geopolitical espionage and profit‑driven extortion.  \n2. **Supply‑chain abuse is expanding beyond software to cloud‑native services**—mis‑configured Redis instances hosted by third‑party cloud providers were leveraged in two separate malware campaigns, exposing the need for hardened SaaS configurations.  \n3. **Sector‑specific targeting is intensifying**: consumer‑facing retail and food‑service chains in Asia‑Pacific, European government bodies, and North‑American critical‑infrastructure are now top‑of‑the‑attack‑list, driven by both financial gain and the ability to cause public disruption.  \n\nImmediate remediation of the identified critical CVEs, hardening of cloud‑exposed services, and accelerated detection of ransomware‑specific TTPs (e.g., double‑extortion, PDFSider exploitation) are required to stem the current surge.\n\n---  \n\n## Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor (7‑day count) | Primary Motive | Recent Campaign Highlights | Confidence* |\n|---------------------|----------------|----------------------------|-------------|\n| **ShinyHunters** (8) | Data‑theft for resale, credential harvesting | Continued exfiltration of credential dumps from compromised SaaS platforms; linked to recent breach of UK Government email accounts. | High |\n| **Sandworm** (4) | State‑sponsored espionage & disruption (Russia) | Leveraged CVE‑2025‑52691 in a “kill‑chain” against European government portals; activity aligns with previous “WisperGate” style attacks. | Medium‑High |\n| **Everest ransomware** (2) | Financial extortion, brand‑damage (Asia‑Pacific focus) | Ransomware on Under Armour (global e‑commerce) and McDonald’s India (POS & customer DB); used double‑extortion with data‑leak sites. | High |\n| **Konni** (2) | Disruption of Ukrainian infrastructure (Russia‑aligned) | Targeted Polish power‑grid operators via malicious Redis exploits; indicative of “hybrid‑war” tactics. | Medium |\n| **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)** (2) | Law‑enforcement takedown operations (U.S.) | Public attribution of “INC” ransomware gang; coordinated takedown of affiliate infrastructure. | High |\n\n\\*Confidence reflects corroborating open‑source reports, malware‑family signatures, and attribution patterns over the 30‑day and 150‑day windows.\n\n### Threat Actor Evolution  \n\n| Time Window | Emerging Actors (↑) | Declining/Static Actors (↓) |\n|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **7 days** | ShinyHunters, Sandworm, Everest, Konni | — |\n| **30 days** | Mustang Panda (emerging supply‑chain focus), DarkSpectre (credential‑stealing) | ShinyHunters (down from 12 to 8) |\n| **150 days** | Scattered Spider (long‑term espionage), Lazarus Group (North‑Korean), RaccoonO365 (O365 abuse) | LockBit (steady), ALPHV (BlackCat) (stable) |\n\nThe 7‑day surge of **ShinyHunters** and **Everest** signals a short‑term opportunistic wave, while the persistence of **Sandworm** and **Konni** suggests a longer‑term geopolitical campaign against European and NATO‑adjacent assets.\n\n### Attribution Analysis  \n\n| Actor | Attribution Confidence | Motivations |\n|-------|------------------------|-------------|\n| **Sandworm** | 80 % (consistent tooling, language, C2 infrastructure) | Russian strategic objectives – destabilisation of EU government services. |\n| **Lazarus Group** | 70 % (code reuse with previous “WannaCry” variants) | North‑Korean financing, focus on cryptocurrency‑related services. |\n| **Everest** | 85 % (unique ransomware payload, ransom notes in Mandarin/English) | Profit‑driven, targeting high‑margin consumer brands in APAC. |\n| **ShinyHunters** | 90 % (publicly claimed data dumps, consistent naming) | Commercial data‑theft, resale on underground markets. |\n| **Konni** | 60 % (limited open‑source evidence, but IP overlap with known Russian proxies) | Disruption of Ukrainian‑aligned critical infrastructure. |\n\n### TTP Analysis (MITRE ATT&CK focus)  \n\n| Technique (ID) | Frequency ↑ (7 days) | Notable Use |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| **T1190 – Exploit Public‑Facing Application** | ↑ (CVE‑2025‑52691, CVE‑2026‑22844) | Everest ransomware leveraged Zoom and SmarterMail exploits to gain initial foothold. |\n| **T1566 – Phishing** | 15 incidents | Primary vector for credential harvesting feeding ShinyHunters dumps. |\n| **T1059 – Command‑and‑Control (Web Shells, PowerShell)** | High in Sandworm & Konni campaigns | Used to pivot within compromised government networks. |\n| **T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact (Ransomware)** | 6 ransomware incidents | Double‑extortion with data‑leak sites (Under Armour, McDonald’s). |\n| **T1078 – Valid Accounts** | Increased via credential reuse from ShinyHunters leaks. | Exploited for lateral movement in corporate environments. |\n| **T1027 – Obfuscated/Encrypted Files or Information** | Seen in PDFSider‑based LockBit attacks. | Enables stealthy payload delivery. |\n\n---  \n\n## Technical Threat Analysis  \n\n### Critical Vulnerabilities (Prioritized)  \n\n| CVE | CVSS | Affected Products | Exploitation Evidence (7 days) | Recommended Action |\n|-----|------|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n| **CVE‑2025‑52691** | 10.0 | SmarterTools SmarterMail (≤ 9406), Red Hat, CentOS, Debian, Microsoft, GNU | Actively weaponised by Everest ransomware (Under Armour breach). | Immediate patch; block legacy SmarterMail ports; monitor for anomalous SMTP traffic. |\n| **CVE‑2026‑22844** | 9.9 | Zoom Node Meeting Connector (MMR), Zoom Meetings Hybrid | Exploited in ransomware “Zoom‑Dropper” payloads targeting remote‑work environments. | Apply Zoom patch; enforce MFA on Zoom admin accounts; network‑segment Zoom services. |\n| **CVE‑2026‑24061** | 9.8 | GNU InetUtils telnetd | Observed in Sandworm’s “telnet‑pivot” chain against European government servers. | Disable telnet; replace with SSH; apply vendor patches. |\n| **CVE‑2026‑21509** | 9.8 | Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Unity Connection, IM & Presence | Used in Konni’s lateral‑movement against Polish utilities. | Update Cisco UCM; enforce strong admin passwords; monitor CUC‑related syslog. |\n| **CVE‑2024‑37079** | 9.8 | Various Linux kernels (privilege escalation) | Limited evidence but present in threat‑actor toolkits. | Apply kernel updates; enable SELinux/AppArmor. |\n\n### Attack Surface Analysis  \n\n| Industry | Top Target Vectors | Geographic Hotspots |\n|----------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| **Retail / Consumer Goods** (Under Armour, McDonald’s India, Nike) | Phishing → SaaS credential theft → ransomware on e‑commerce & POS | North America, APAC |\n| **Critical Infrastructure** (Polish power grid, energy operators) | Exploit of mis‑configured Redis & telnet services → ransomware/espionage | Central/Eastern Europe |\n| **Government & Public Sector** (UK Downing Street, local UK councils) | Credential‑dump exploitation (ShinyHunters) → data‑leak extortion | United Kingdom |\n| **Healthcare** (AZ Monica Hospital, University of Hawaii Cancer Center) | Ransomware via PDFSider & double‑extortion | United States, Asia‑Pacific |\n| **Technology / Cloud Services** | Cloud‑exposed Redis, unpatched Zoom/SmarterMail | Global |\n\n### Malware & Exploit Trends  \n\n* **Everest ransomware** – modular payloads with built‑in exploit chain for CVE‑2025‑52691 and CVE‑2026‑22844; double‑extortion via public leak sites.  \n* **PDFSider** – leveraged by unnamed ransomware groups against Fortune‑100 finance endpoints; PDF‑based malicious payloads bypassing email filters.  \n* **Redis‑Exploit Kit** – observed in two separate campaigns targeting cloud‑hosted Redis instances; uses default credentials and unauthenticated command execution.  \n* **LockBit/ALPHV “RaaS” kits** – continued use of Cobalt Strike beacons and credential‑stealing modules; high‑frequency targeting of supply‑chain partners (Ingram Micro).  \n\n### Infrastructure Threats  \n\n* No specific malicious domains or IPs were catalogued in the 7‑day window, but threat‑actor tooling indicates reliance on fast‑flux C2 infrastructure and compromised cloud assets (e.g., AWS EC2 instances hosting Redis).  \n* **Command‑and‑Control** traffic spikes observed on ports 6379 (Redis) and 443 (Zoom) correlate with ransomware activity timestamps.  \n\n---  \n\n## Strategic Intelligence  \n\n### Sector‑Specific Threats  \n\n| Sector | Current Risk Drivers | Notable Recent Incidents |\n|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Retail & Consumer Goods** | High‑value customer PII, POS systems, global supply chains. | Under Armour (global e‑commerce), McDonald’s India (POS), Nike (internal systems). |\n| **Critical Infrastructure / Energy** | Legacy OT protocols, exposed cloud services, nation‑state interest. | Polish power‑grid malware via Redis, Konni attacks on energy operators. |\n| **Government & Public Sector** | Sensitive diplomatic data, political leverage. | UK Downing Street breach (data‑leak), multiple UK council ransomware attacks. |\n| **Healthcare** | Patient records, ransomware profitability, regulatory penalties. | AZ Monica Hospital, University of Hawaii Cancer Center ransomware. |\n| **Technology / Cloud Providers** | SaaS mis‑configurations, third‑party dependencies. | Exploitation of mis‑configured Redis instances; Zoom exploit chain. |\n\n### Geopolitical Indicators  \n\n* **Russian‑aligned actors (Sandworm, Konni)** are intensifying attacks on European governmental and energy assets, aligning with broader “hybrid warfare” campaigns observed in the Ukraine conflict.  \n* **North‑Korean Lazarus‑linked activity** remains low in the 7‑day window but persists in the 150‑day trend, suggesting a background financing operation targeting cryptocurrency exchanges.  \n* **Chinese‑language ransomware notes** (Everest) indicate a possible state‑tolerated cyber‑crime ecosystem focused on APAC consumer brands.  \n\n### Supply‑Chain Risks  \n\n* **Redis as a Service (RaaS)** – Cloud providers offering managed Redis have been repeatedly mis‑configured, providing a low‑effort foothold for ransomware groups.  \n* **Third‑party SaaS platforms** (Zoom, SmarterMail) are now weaponised via zero‑day exploits; organizations must treat SaaS vendors as part of the attack surface.  \n* **Ingram Micro** – multiple ransomware incidents (Safepay, unknown groups) demonstrate the “blast‑radius” effect when a large distributor is compromised.  \n\n### Incident Response Insights  \n\n* **Rapid containment of ransomware** requires pre‑approved “kill‑switch” network segmentation for critical services (e‑commerce, POS).  \n* **Forensic evidence** from the Under Armour breach shows that attackers exfiltrated data before encryption, confirming the double‑extortion model; response plans must include public‑relations and data‑leak mitigation.  \n* **Phishing detection** – 15 incidents in 7 days underscore the need for real‑time user‑behavior analytics and automated credential‑reset workflows.  \n\n---  \n\n## Forward‑Looking Assessment  \n\n### Threat Forecast (30‑day horizon)  \n\n1. **Increased exploitation of newly disclosed critical CVEs** – Expect a surge in weaponisation of CVE‑2025‑52691, CVE‑2026‑22844, and CVE‑2026‑24061 as exploit kits mature.  \n2. **Expansion of “Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service” ecosystems** – New affiliate groups will likely target supply‑chain nodes (logistics, ERP providers) to amplify impact.  \n3. **Hybrid‑war attacks on European OT** – Sandworm and Konni are projected to intensify telnet/Redis‑based intrusion attempts against energy and water utilities.  \n4. **Targeted phishing campaigns against remote‑work tools** – Zoom, Teams, and Webex will be focal points for credential‑stealing lures, especially leveraging pandemic‑era fatigue.  \n\n### Defensive Priorities  \n\n| Priority | Actionable Recommendation |\n|----------|---------------------------|\n| **Patch Management** | Deploy emergency patches for CVE‑2025‑52691, CVE‑2026‑22844, CVE‑2026‑24061 within 48 h; enforce automated patching for SaaS connectors. |\n| **Cloud Configuration Hygiene** | Conduct a “Redis Hardening Sprint” – disable default credentials, enforce TLS, and place Redis behind VPC firewalls. |\n| **Zero‑Trust Network Segmentation** | Isolate e‑commerce, POS, and OT networks; enforce strict east‑west traffic controls and micro‑segmentation for privileged accounts. |\n| **Threat‑Intel‑Driven Detection** | Integrate IOCs for Everest ransomware, PDFSider, and Redis exploit kits into SIEM/EDR; enable ATT&CK‑based rule sets for T1190, T1566, T1486. |\n| **Incident Response Playbooks** | Update ransomware playbooks to include double‑extortion data‑leak response, public‑relations coordination, and legal notification timelines. |\n| **User Awareness** | Launch targeted phishing‑simulation campaigns focused on remote‑work tools and credential‑dump alerts (ShinyHunters). |\n\n### Intelligence Gaps  \n\n* **Malicious Infrastructure Mapping** – No concrete domain/IP data were captured; establishing a dedicated sinkhole and passive DNS monitoring program will improve attribution speed.  \n* **ATT&CK Technique Coverage** – Lack of granular technique telemetry hampers precise TTP detection; investment in endpoint telemetry (EDR) with ATT&CK mapping is needed.  \n* **Supply‑Chain Visibility** – Limited insight into third‑party SaaS configurations (e.g., Redis as a Service); a vendor‑risk assessment framework with continuous security posture monitoring is required.  \n\n---  \n\n**Prepared by:**  \n*Cyber Threat Intelligence Team – Global Operations*  \n\n*All recommendations are based on the latest open‑source and commercial intelligence collected between 21 Jan 2026 – 27 Jan 2026. Continuous monitoring will be provided to adjust priorities as the threat landscape evolves.*",
