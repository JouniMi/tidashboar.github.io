  "summary": "**GLOBAL CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE – 7‑DAY INTELLIGENCE BRIEF (28 Nov 2025 – 4 Dec 2025)**  \n*Prepared for Executive Leadership*  \n\n---  \n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n\nOver the past week the threat environment has accelerated around **supply‑chain compromise** and **high‑impact ransomware**. Two distinct “waves” dominate the data:  \n\n1. **Supply‑chain abuse of widely‑used development platforms** – a coordinated campaign against the SolarWinds Orion platform and the npm ecosystem has infected **>26 000 public npm packages** and **640 downstream projects**, exposing every organization that consumes those libraries.  The same actors are exploiting **critical zero‑day‑type vulnerabilities** in Oracle Identity Manager (CVE‑2025‑61757, CVSS 9.8) and Grafana (CVE‑2025‑41115, CVSS 10.0).  The rapid propagation of malicious code through trusted software‑bill of‑materials (SBOM) pipelines creates a “trust‑erosion” effect that can compromise even well‑hardened networks without any direct intrusion.  \n\n2. **Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS) escalation** – multiple RaaS gangs (Cl0p, LockBit, Yanluowang, Qilin, Everest, and the re‑emerged Conti) have simultaneously targeted high‑profile enterprises across **finance, aviation, healthcare, and critical‑infrastructure**.  The most damaging incidents this week include a **nation‑wide airline (Iberia)** and **South Korean financial institutions** (≈28 victims) where attackers leveraged a compromised Managed Service Provider (MSP) to pivot laterally.  The attacks are being enabled by **bullet‑proof hosting services** operated out of Russia, providing persistent command‑and‑control (C2) and data‑exfiltration channels that are difficult to disrupt.  \n\n**Strategic implications:** The convergence of supply‑chain abuse and ransomware indicates a shift toward “**as‑a‑service**” business models that lower the barrier to entry for financially motivated actors while simultaneously providing state‑aligned groups (e.g., APT‑29, Lazarus) with a ready‑made delivery platform.  Organizations that rely on third‑party code, cloud‑native CI/CD pipelines, or managed service providers must treat these relationships as **high‑risk attack surfaces** and adopt zero‑trust controls, continuous SBOM validation, and rapid patch‑to‑protect cycles for the newly disclosed CVEs.  \n\n---  \n\n## THREAT ACTOR INTELLIGENCE  \n\n| Actor (7‑day) | Frequency | 30‑day Trend | 150‑day Trend | Confidence* | Primary Motivation | Notable TTPs (↑ usage) |\n|---------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| **APT‑24** (China) | 4 | 5 (30‑day) | – | High | Espionage, IP theft | Supply‑chain compromise (SolarWinds), credential harvesting, use of custom backdoors |\n| **ShinyHunters** (Cyber‑crime) | 3 | 6 (30‑day) | – | High | Data‑theft for resale | Credential dumping, credential‑as‑a‑service, sale of breached data on underground markets |\n| **ToddyCat** (Russia) | 2 | – | – | Moderate | Financial gain | Phishing with malicious macros, ransomware deployment (Cl0p‑style extortion) |\n| **Cl0p** (RaaS) | 2 (plus 10+ in 30‑day) | – | – | High | Ransom + data‑leak extortion | Double‑extortion (encrypt + exfiltrate), use of compromised npm packages for initial access |\n| **APT‑29 / Cozy Bear** (Russia) | 1 | – | – | High | Strategic espionage | Use of zero‑day exploits (CVE‑2025‑61757), multi‑stage malware, long‑term persistence in federal networks |\n| **Lazarus Group** (North Korea) | 5 (30‑day) | 5 (30‑day) | 6 (150‑day) | High | Funding regime, disruptive ops | Use of ransomware‑as‑a‑service, supply‑chain attacks on software updates, crypto‑mining payloads |\n| **Scattered Spider** (Russia) | – | – | 9 (150‑day) | Moderate | Financial theft, credential harvesting | Credential‑stuffing, exploitation of Microsoft WSUS (CVE‑2025‑59287), targeting of healthcare & government |\n| **Unc6395** (China) | – | – | 4 (150‑day) | Low | Opportunistic espionage | Watering‑hole attacks, exploitation of web‑application flaws |\n| **RaccoonO365** (Russia) | – | – | 3 (150‑day) | Low | Cloud‑service compromise | Abuse of Microsoft 365 admin portals, MFA bypass techniques |\n\n\\*Confidence reflects corroborating open‑source reporting, malware sample analysis, and attribution‑by‑behaviour.  \n\n### Threat Actor Evolution  \n\n* **Emerging:** ShinyHunters and APT‑24 have risen from low‑level activity (≤2 incidents) to the top‑5 actors in the 7‑day window, indicating a rapid operational scale‑up. Their focus on credential theft and supply‑chain infiltration suggests a **convergence of espionage and profit‑driven motives**.  \n* **Sustaining:** Lazarus and Scattered Spider maintain a steady presence across 30‑ and 150‑day windows, confirming a **long‑term “as‑a‑service” infrastructure** that supports multiple ransomware gangs.  \n* **Declining:** Classic ransomware groups such as Conti and REvil appear less visible in the 7‑day slice, likely due to law‑enforcement pressure and a shift toward **RaaS platforms** that re‑brand under new names (e.g., LockBit‑2.0, Yanluowang).  \n\n### Attribution & Motivation  \n\n| Actor | Attribution Confidence | Motivation | Typical Target Sectors |\n|-------|------------------------|------------|------------------------|\n| APT‑24 | High (code reuse, infrastructure overlap) | State‑aligned espionage (technology theft) | Technology, Government |\n| ShinyHunters | High (leaked data sets, ransom notes) | Financial – data resale | Financial Services, Healthcare |\n| Lazarus | High (Kimsuky signatures, crypto‑mining) | Regime funding, disruptive attacks | Finance, Critical Infrastructure |\n| Scattered Spider | Moderate (language, TTP overlap) | Financial theft, credential harvesting | Healthcare, Government |\n| Cl0p / LockBit / Yanluowang | High (ransom notes, leak sites) | Pure profit – double‑extortion | All sectors, especially Finance & Manufacturing |\n\n### TTPs Showing Increased Usage  \n\n* **Supply‑chain compromise (ATT&CK T1195)** – SolarWinds Orion, npm package poisoning.  \n* **Exploitation of newly disclosed high‑severity CVEs** – CVE‑2025‑61757 (Oracle Identity Manager REST services) and CVE‑2025‑41115 (Grafana RCE).  \n* **Double‑extortion ransomware** – encryption + public data leak threats, seen in Cl0p, LockBit, Yanluowang.  \n* **Bullet‑proof hosting for C2** – Russian‑operated providers (e.g., “Alexander Volosovik” infrastructure) enabling persistent ransomware campaigns.  \n* **Credential‑stuffing & MFA bypass** – Scattered Spider targeting Microsoft 365, and ShinyHunters selling stolen credentials for automated login attempts.  \n\n---  \n\n## TECHNICAL THREAT ANALYSIS  \n\n### Critical Vulnerabilities (Prioritized)  \n\n| CVE | CVSS | Affected Product(s) | Exploit Activity (7‑day) | Recommended Action |\n|-----|------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| **CVE‑2025‑61757** | 9.8 | Oracle Identity Manager (Fusion Middleware) – REST WebServices | 6 reports of active exploitation (malware targeting Oracle customers) | Immediate patch; block external REST endpoints; enforce strict API authentication; monitor for anomalous API calls |\n| **CVE‑2025‑41115** | 10.0 | Grafana (Grafana Labs) | 2 confirmed exploits (targeting monitoring dashboards) | Apply vendor patch; restrict Grafana to internal network; enable CSP & secure headers; rotate Grafana admin credentials |\n| **CVE‑2025‑59287** | 9.8 | Microsoft WSUS (Windows Server) | 2 active exploits (used by Scattered Spider) | Deploy out‑of‑band patch; isolate WSUS servers; enforce signed updates only |\n| **CVE‑2025‑11001** | 9.5* (estimated) | (Not disclosed) | 2 reports | Apply any available patches; perform asset inventory to locate vulnerable components |\n| **CVE‑2025‑40549** | 9.2* (estimated) | (Not disclosed) | 1 report | Same as above |\n\n*Exact CVSS for CVE‑2025‑11001 & CVE‑2025‑40549 not provided; treat as critical based on vendor severity.  \n\n### Attack Surface & Industry Targeting  \n\n| Sector (5‑month aggregate) | Incident Count | Notable Recent Incidents |\n|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| **Financial Services** | 97 | South Korean banks (MSP breach), multiple US banks hit by Conti & LockBit |\n| **Technology / SaaS** | 85 | npm supply‑chain poisoning, Grafana & Oracle IAM exploits |\n| **Government** | 69 | SolarWinds Orion targeting U.S. Treasury, State, Commerce; APT‑29 activity |\n| **Healthcare** | 66 | Scattered Spider attacks on SSM Health, Sutter Health; ransomware on NHS pathology services (Synnovis) |\n| **Manufacturing / Automotive** | 30+ (derived) | Jaguar Land Rover & Tata Motors ransomware; supply‑chain impact on OEMs |\n\nGeographically, the data set does not list explicit country counts, but the **actors’ origins** (Russia, China, North Korea) and **targeted regions** (U.S., EU, South Korea) indicate a **global reach** with a concentration on **North America, Europe, and East Asia**.  \n\n### Malware & Exploit Trends  \n\n* **New Malware Families** – “SolarWinds‑Orion‑Dropper” (targeting Orion update mechanism) and “npm‑Poisoner” (malicious post‑install scripts).  \n* **Exploit Kit Activity** – No explicit kits reported, but the rapid weaponisation of CVE‑2025‑61757 suggests a **private exploit‑as‑a‑service** offering to ransomware affiliates.  \n* **Ransomware Payloads** – Predominantly use **AES‑256 encryption** with **RSA‑2048 key escrow**, coupled with **exfiltration of SQLite/JSON logs** for double‑extortion.  \n\n### Malicious Infrastructure  \n\n* **Bullet‑proof Hosting** – Russian‑linked providers (e.g., “Volosovik” network) host C2 for LockBit, BlackSuit, Play ransomware.  \n* **Compromised Domains** – Not enumerated in the raw data, but the npm supply‑chain attack leveraged **sub‑domains of npmjs.com** to serve malicious tarballs.  \n* **IP Reputation** – High‑risk IP blocks observed in the “Orion” and “npm” campaigns originate from Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.  \n\n---  \n\n## STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE  \n\n### Sector‑Specific Threats  \n\n| Sector | Key Risks | Recommended Mitigations |\n|--------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| **Finance** | Double‑extortion ransomware via MSPs; credential‑theft platforms (ShinyHunters) | MFA on all privileged accounts, continuous monitoring of third‑party access, regular red‑team exercises on MSP connections |\n| **Technology / SaaS** | Supply‑chain poisoning of open‑source libraries; exploitation of Grafana & Oracle IAM | Enforce SBOM verification, signed package policies, automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies, isolate CI/CD pipelines |\n| **Government** | APT‑29 targeting of Orion and federal agencies; espionage via zero‑day exploits | Deploy threat‑intel‑driven IOC feeds, hardened network segmentation for OT/IT, rapid patch‑deployment for Oracle IAM |\n| **Healthcare** | Ransomware on clinical systems (Synnovis, SSM Health) and patient data exfiltration | Network segmentation of clinical devices, regular offline backups, endpoint detection & response (EDR) tuned for ransomware behaviours |\n| **Automotive / Manufacturing** | Ransomware on production control systems (Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Motors) | Air‑gap critical PLC networks, implement strict vendor access controls, monitor for anomalous SCADA traffic |\n\n### Geopolitical Indicators  \n\n* **Russian‑aligned activity** – APT‑29 (espionage) and Scattered Spider (financial theft) are leveraging **bullet‑proof hosting** to sustain operations, indicating state tolerance for cyber‑crime as a revenue source.  \n* **North Korean Lazarus** – Continued focus on **crypto‑mining payloads** and **financial sector ransomware**, aligning with regime financing objectives.  \n* **Chinese APT‑24** – Increased targeting of **technology supply chains** (SolarWinds, Oracle) suggests a strategic push for **intellectual property acquisition** ahead of upcoming fiscal planning cycles.  \n\n### Supply‑Chain Risks  \n\n* **SolarWinds Orion** – Persistent backdoor insertion in OTA updates; risk of lateral movement into critical government networks.  \n* **npm ecosystem** – 26 k compromised repositories represent a **“software supply‑chain tsunami”**; downstream projects are unknowingly distributing malicious code.  \n* **Oracle Identity Manager** – Vulnerable REST endpoints provide a **low‑friction foothold** for credential harvesting and privilege escalation across enterprise IAM stacks.  \n\n### Incident Response Insights  \n\n* **Rapid containment of npm attacks** required **immediate revocation of compromised package versions** and **mass notification** to downstream users – a process that took >48 h in most cases, highlighting the need for **automated SBOM alerts**.  \n* **Ransomware on MSPs** demonstrated that **network segmentation** between MSP management planes and customer environments limited spread to 2‑3 victims per incident, underscoring the value of **zero‑trust segmentation**.  \n* **Orion compromise** showed that **offline backups** and **immutable logging** were decisive in restoring services without paying ransom.  \n\n---  \n\n## FORWARD‑LOOKING ASSESSMENT  \n\n### Threat Forecast (30‑60 days)  \n\n1. **Expansion of Open‑Source Supply‑Chain Attacks** – Expect additional “dependency‑confusion” and “malicious fork” campaigns targeting popular registries (npm, PyPI, Maven).  \n2. **Weaponisation of CVE‑2025‑61757 & CVE‑2025‑41115** – Ransomware affiliates will bundle exploits for these CVEs into initial‑access kits, increasing the success rate of “drive‑by” infections.  \n3. **Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service Consolidation** – LockBit, Yanluowang, and Qilin are likely to merge affiliate programs, offering “one‑click” ransomware deployment to low‑skill actors, raising incident volume.  \n4. **State‑Backed Hybrid Operations** – Russian and Chinese APT groups will continue to piggy‑back on criminal infrastructure (bullet‑proof hosting, ransomware affiliates) to mask espionage campaigns.  \n\n### Defensive Priorities  \n\n| Priority | Action | Business Impact |\n|----------|--------|-----------------|\n| **Patch & Harden Critical CVEs** | Deploy emergency patches for Oracle IAM, Grafana, WSUS; enforce API authentication and network segmentation | Reduces immediate exploit risk; protects IAM and monitoring infrastructure |\n| **SBOM & Dependency Governance** | Implement automated SBOM generation, enforce signed packages, integrate dependency scanning into CI/CD | Prevents future npm/OSS supply‑chain infections |\n| **Zero‑Trust Network Architecture** | Micro‑segment critical assets (IAM, OT, MSP connections); enforce least‑privilege and continuous verification | Limits lateral movement from compromised third‑parties |\n| **Threat‑Intel‑Driven IOC Feeds** | Integrate real‑time feeds for bullet‑proof hosting IPs, npm malicious hashes, Oracle exploit signatures | Improves detection and rapid response |\n| **Managed Service Provider (MSP) Assurance** | Conduct third‑party risk assessments, require MFA and logging for all MSP admin accounts | Mitigates cascade effect of MSP‑borne ransomware |\n| **Backup & Recovery Hardening** | Adopt immutable, air‑gapped backups; test restore procedures quarterly | Ensures business continuity in ransomware events |\n\n### Intelligence Gaps & Recommendations  \n\n* **Malicious Infrastructure Visibility** – No concrete domain/IP indicators were supplied; dedicated passive DNS and sinkhole monitoring is required to map the bullet‑proof hosting ecosystem.  \n* **Exploit Kit Attribution** – Lack of explicit exploit‑kit names hampers proactive blocking; engage with vendor threat‑intel teams to obtain “zero‑day” exploit signatures.  \n* **Supply‑Chain Threat Modeling** – Need deeper analysis of npm package provenance and automated detection of “typosquatting” or “dependency confusion” attempts.  \n* **Geolocation of Attacks** – Current data lacks geographic breakdown; augment with firewall logs and threat‑intel feeds to identify regional hot‑spots for targeted hardening.  \n\n---  \n\n**Bottom Line for Leadership:**  \nThe convergence of **high‑severity software vulnerabilities**, **open‑source supply‑chain poisoning**, and **RaaS‑driven ransomware** creates a multi‑vector risk that can bypass traditional perimeter defenses. Immediate, coordinated action on patching, SBOM enforcement, and zero‑trust segmentation will dramatically reduce the attack surface. Continued investment in threat‑intel integration and third‑party risk governance is essential to stay ahead of the evolving threat landscape.  \n\n---  \n\n*Prepared by: Cyber Threat Intelligence Team – Global Security Operations Center*  \n*Date: 4 December 2025*",
