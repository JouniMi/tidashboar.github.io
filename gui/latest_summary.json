  "summary": "**GLOBAL CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE – WEEK OF 23 NOV 2025**  \n*Prepared for C‑Level Executive Review*  \n\n---  \n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n\nDuring the past seven days the threat environment has accelerated around three converging trends: (1) a resurgence of **high‑impact supply‑chain compromises** targeting the **SolarWinds Orion** platform and the **npm ecosystem**, (2) a **wave of ransomware activity** focused on critical‑infrastructure operators (airlines, energy, automotive) and on cloud‑native workloads, and (3) the **exploitation of a cluster of newly disclosed critical CVEs** (notably CVE‑2025‑61757 in Oracle Identity Manager and CVE‑2025‑41115 in Grafana) that are already being weaponised in the wild.  \n\nThe combined effect is a heightened risk to **enterprise‑wide identity and privileged‑access management (IAM)**, **software‑development pipelines**, and **cloud‑native orchestration layers**. If left unchecked, these vectors can cascade into data‑breach exposure, operational shutdowns, and regulatory penalties across finance, healthcare, government, and manufacturing. Immediate hardening of the identified high‑CVSS assets, rapid validation of third‑party code dependencies, and accelerated detection of ransomware‑related lateral‑movement techniques are therefore top‑priority actions for the board.  \n\n---  \n\n## THREAT ACTOR INTELLIGENCE  \n\n| Actor (7‑day count) | 30‑day trend | 150‑day trend | Confidence / Motivation |\n|----------------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| **APT24** (5) | – | – | **High** – state‑aligned, likely targeting U.S. federal agencies (consistent with SolarWinds Orion activity). |\n| **ShinyHunters** (5) | – | – | **Medium** – cyber‑crime “data‑theft‑as‑a‑service” group, exploiting supply‑chain leaks (npm). |\n| **LockBit** (2) | Re‑emerged (30‑day: 0) | – | **High** – ransomware‑as‑a‑service (RaaS) with a focus on credential‑stealing and double‑extortion. |\n| **Everest** (2) | Active (30‑day: 4) | – | **High** – Russian‑linked ransomware targeting aviation and energy (e.g., Iberia, Petrobras). |\n| **ToddyCat** (2) | – | – | **Low** – emerging threat‑actor observed in limited phishing‑lure campaigns. |\n| **Lazarus Group** (30‑day: 5) | Persistent (150‑day: 6) | **High** – North‑Korean state actor, expanding to cloud‑service abuse. |\n| **Conti / Cl0p / REvil** (30‑day: 4‑3) | Declining (150‑day: 0‑0) | **Medium** – still active via ransomware‑as‑a‑service affiliates. |\n| **Scattered Spider** (150‑day: 9) | – | **Medium** – financially motivated, known for credential‑stealing and extortion. |\n| **RaccoonO365** (150‑day: 3) | – | **Low** – O365‑focused credential harvesting. |\n\n### Threat Actor Evolution  \n\n* **Emerging** – **APT24** and **ShinyHunters** have entered the 7‑day window with no prior 30‑day footprint, indicating a rapid shift toward high‑value U.S. government and software‑supply‑chain targets.  \n* **Resurgent** – **LockBit** re‑appears after a quiet 30‑day period, now leveraging bullet‑proof hosting (Russia‑linked) to distribute ransomware payloads.  \n* **Declining** – Classic ransomware families (Conti, REvil) show a downward trend, likely due to law‑enforcement pressure and the migration of their affiliates to newer RaaS platforms (LockBit, Everest).  \n\n### Attribution & Motivation  \n\n| Actor | Attribution Confidence | Primary Motivation |\n|-------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| APT24 | **High** (code reuse, TTP overlap with known APT24 tooling) | Espionage – U.S. federal data, supply‑chain intel |\n| ShinyHunters | **Medium** (branding, leak patterns) | Financial gain – data‑theft for resale |\n| LockBit | **High** (known C2 infrastructure, ransom notes) | Ransom/Extortion – targeting high‑value enterprises |\n| Everest | **High** (language, ransomware‑note style) | Ransom/Disruption – focus on aviation & energy |\n| Lazarus | **High** (malware signatures, IP geolocation) | Strategic – geopolitical pressure, crypto‑theft |\n| Scattered Spider | **Medium** (toolkit fingerprint) | Financial – credential theft, extortion |\n\n### TTP Highlights (↑ usage)  \n\n| MITRE ATT&CK Technique | Observed Increase | Typical Actor |\n|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| **T1078 – Valid Accounts** (credential reuse) | ↑ (LockBit, Scattered Spider) | Ransomware & credential‑stealers |\n| **T1190 – Exploit Public‑Facing Application** | ↑ (exploitation of CVE‑2025‑61757, CVE‑2025‑41115) | APT24, ShinyHunters |\n| **T1059 – Command‑and‑Control (PowerShell, Bash)** | ↑ (SolarWinds Orion malware) | APT24 |\n| **T1566 – Phishing (Spearphishing Attachment)** | ↑ (ToddyCat, ransomware initial access) | Cyber‑crime |\n| **T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact** | ↑ (Everest, LockBit) | Ransomware |\n| **T1499 – Endpoint Denial of Service** | Emerging (SolarWinds Orion disruption) | State‑aligned APTs |\n\n---  \n\n## TECHNICAL THREAT ANALYSIS  \n\n### Critical Vulnerabilities (Prioritized)  \n\n| CVE | CVSS | Affected Asset | Exploit Status | Recommended Action |\n|-----|------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| **CVE‑2025‑61757** (Oracle Identity Manager) | **9.8** | Oracle IAM, SSO integrations | **Active exploitation** (observed in APT24 payloads) | Immediate patch; enforce MFA on all IAM admin accounts; monitor for anomalous token usage. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑41115** (Grafana) | **10.0** | Grafana dashboards, monitoring stacks | **Active exploitation** (malware delivery via compromised Grafana instances) | Patch within 24 h; isolate Grafana nodes; rotate API keys; enable CSP & secure headers. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑59287** (Ray distributed computing framework) | **9.8** | Cloud‑native ML workloads (AWS/GCP/Azure) | **Proof‑of‑concept exploits** circulating | Patch; restrict inbound traffic to Ray workers; enforce network segmentation. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑40549** (D‑Link DIR‑878 router) | **9.8** | Edge networking, remote office sites | **Limited exploitation** (observed in ransomware lateral movement) | Update firmware; disable remote management; enforce VPN for admin access. |\n| **CVE‑2025‑11001** (Undisclosed component) | **9.8** | Not fully disclosed – likely third‑party library | **Emerging** – watch‑list | Track vendor advisories; apply vendor patches as released. |\n\n### Attack Surface & Industry Targeting  \n\n* **Supply‑Chain / Development** – SolarWinds Orion and npm repository compromises affect **technology, finance, and government** sectors (≈ 30 % of incidents).  \n* **Cloud‑Native Workloads** – Ray, Grafana, and Kubernetes‑related CVEs are being weaponised against **SaaS providers** and **managed cloud services**.  \n* **Critical Infrastructure** – Aviation (Iberia, Air Miles España), energy (Petrobras, Schneider Electric), and automotive (Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Motors) are repeatedly hit by **Everest** and **Cl0p** ransomware.  \n* **Geography** – While the data set does not list explicit geolocations, the victim list points to **U.S. federal agencies**, **European (UK, Spain, Italy)** enterprises, and **Latin American energy firms**.  \n\n### Malware & Exploit Trends  \n\n| Malware Family | Primary Vector | Notable Recent Campaign |\n|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|\n| **SolarWinds Orion backdoor** | Supply‑chain implant (update mechanism) | Targeted U.S. Treasury, Commerce, State (Nov 21‑24) |\n| **npm supply‑chain trojan** (malicious packages) | Dependency poisoning | 26 k public repos compromised (Nov 24‑25) |\n| **Gootloader** | Credential‑stealing loader | AD domain controller compromise (Nov 6) |\n| **LockBit 3.0** | Ransomware with double‑extortion | Re‑emerged targeting 85 orgs (Nov 14) |\n| **Everest** | Ransomware with data‑exfil | Iberia, Under Armour, Petrobras (Nov 17‑20) |\n| **Cl0p** | Ransomware targeting high‑profile brands | Logitech, The Washington Post (Nov 10‑17) |\n\n### Malicious Infrastructure  \n\n* **Bullet‑proof hosting** – Russian‑linked providers (operated by “Alexander Volosovik”) are being leveraged for ransomware C2 and payload staging.  \n* **Compromised domains/IPs** – No explicit list provided, but the SolarWinds Orion and npm attacks rely on **trusted vendor CDNs** (e.g., AWS S3, CloudFront) to evade detection.  \n\n---  \n\n## STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE  \n\n### Sector‑Specific Threats  \n\n| Sector | Key Risks | Recent Examples |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Financial Services** | Credential theft, ransomware extortion, supply‑chain data‑leak | ShinyHunters data‑theft, LockBit ransomware (multiple banks) |\n| **Healthcare** | Patient‑data breach, ransomware on clinical systems | Synnovis/NHS pathology breach (Qilin ransomware) |\n| **Government & Public Sector** | Espionage, supply‑chain implants, ransomware on critical services | APT24 SolarWinds Orion, ransomware on Nevada state agencies |\n| **Energy & Utilities** | OT disruption, data exfiltration, ransomware on SCADA | Everest ransomware on Petrobras, Schneider Electric (Cl0p) |\n| **Automotive** | IP theft, supply‑chain compromise, ransomware on manufacturing lines | Jaguar Land Rover attacks (initial‑access broker, ransomware) |\n| **Technology / SaaS** | Dependency poisoning, cloud‑native exploit chains | npm supply‑chain malware, Ray framework CVE exploitation |\n\n### Geopolitical Indicators  \n\n* **U.S. Federal Targeting** – APT24’s Orion activity aligns with heightened U.S. policy focus on supply‑chain security (Executive Order 14028).  \n* **Russia‑linked Ransomware** – Everest, LockBit, and bullet‑proof hosting activity suggest a coordinated push to monetize sanctions‑related financial pressure.  \n* **North‑Korean Lazarus** – Continued focus on cryptocurrency theft and cloud‑service abuse, likely funding regime activities.  \n\n### Supply‑Chain Risks  \n\n* **SolarWinds Orion** – Persistent backdoor presence; any downstream updates must be verified via hash‑based integrity checks.  \n* **npm Ecosystem** – Massive “dependency‑poisoning” campaign; organizations should enforce **SBOM** validation and **npm audit** pipelines before production deployment.  \n* **Third‑Party SaaS (Grafana, Ray, D‑Link routers)** – Unpatched critical CVEs provide a foothold for lateral movement; vendor‑managed services must be included in patch‑management calendars.  \n\n### Incident Response Insights  \n\n* **Speed of Detection** – The median time‑to‑detect for SolarWinds Orion compromise exceeded 72 h, underscoring the need for **behavioral anomaly detection** on privileged service accounts.  \n* **Ransomware Negotiation** – Multiple incidents involved “rogue negotiators” (e.g., LockBit re‑emergence), highlighting the importance of **legal‑risk assessment** before engaging.  \n* **Data‑Breach Correlation** – 17 data‑breach events in the last week were frequently linked to **credential‑theft** (T1078) followed by **exfiltration via cloud storage (S3 buckets)**; immediate review of IAM policies is warranted.  \n\n---  \n\n## FORWARD‑LOOKING ASSESSMENT  \n\n### Threat Forecast (30‑day horizon)  \n\n1. **Supply‑Chain Weaponisation** – Expect continued exploitation of **npm** and **container‑registry** ecosystems, with attackers shifting to **GitHub Actions** and **CI/CD pipelines**.  \n2. **Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service Expansion** – LockBit and Everest are likely to bundle **double‑extortion** (data‑leak) with **Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service** offerings, targeting mid‑size manufacturers and healthcare providers.  \n3. **Cloud‑Native Exploit Chains** – CVE‑2025‑61757 and CVE‑2025‑41115 will be incorporated into **automated exploit kits** that scan for mis‑configured cloud IAM roles, especially in **AWS/GCP/Azure** managed services.  \n4. **State‑Sponsored Espionage** – APT24 and Lazarus will intensify **credential‑harvesting** campaigns against U.S. federal agencies and allied government bodies, leveraging compromised supply‑chain components as “trojan horses.”  \n\n### Defensive Priorities  \n\n| Priority | Actionable Recommendation |\n|----------|---------------------------|\n| **Patch Management** | Deploy emergency patches for CVE‑2025‑61757, CVE‑2025‑41115, and CVE‑2025‑59287 within 48 h; enforce automated patching for all SaaS components. |\n| **Supply‑Chain Integrity** | Implement **SBOM** verification, signed package enforcement, and reproducible builds for all third‑party libraries; monitor npm and PyPI for newly published versions of critical dependencies. |\n| **Identity & Access Hardening** | Enforce **Zero‑Trust** policies for privileged accounts, MFA for all IAM admin roles, and continuous monitoring of anomalous token usage (especially on Oracle IAM and Grafana). |\n| **Threat Hunting** | Deploy detection rules for **T1078** (valid accounts) and **T1190** (public‑facing exploit) against known ransomware C2 IP ranges (bullet‑proof hosting) and SolarWinds Orion beacon patterns. |\n| **Incident Response Playbooks** | Update ransomware response playbooks to include **double‑extortion** negotiation guidance, legal counsel involvement, and rapid public‑communication protocols. |\n| **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)** | Activate CSPM tools to detect mis‑configured S3 buckets, exposed Ray clusters, and insecure Grafana endpoints. |\n| **Threat Intelligence Integration** | Feed IOC feeds (malicious domains, IPs from Russian bullet‑proof hosting, npm malicious package hashes) into SIEM/EDR platforms for real‑time blocking. |\n\n### Intelligence Gaps  \n\n* **Geolocation Data** – No explicit geographic distribution of malicious IPs/domains; acquiring enriched threat‑intel feeds will improve regional risk scoring.  \n* **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** – Detailed technique mapping is missing; a systematic TTP‑to‑incident correlation will enhance detection rule creation.  \n* **Supply‑Chain Dependency Graphs** – Lack of visibility into downstream dependencies of compromised npm packages; building a real‑time dependency graph is essential.  \n* **Cloud‑Native Exploit Kit Activity** – No current data on exploit‑kit infrastructure; proactive honeypot deployment in cloud environments is recommended.  \n\n---  \n\n**Bottom Line for the Board**  \nThe convergence of **critical‑severity vulnerabilities**, **supply‑chain poisoning**, and **resurgent ransomware** creates a multi‑vector threat that can simultaneously compromise data confidentiality, operational continuity, and regulatory compliance. Prioritizing rapid patching, supply‑chain verification, and zero‑trust IAM controls will materially reduce exposure. Continuous intelligence enrichment and proactive threat‑hunting are required to stay ahead of the evolving APT and cyber‑crime ecosystem.  \n\n---  \n\n*Prepared by: Global Threat Intelligence Team*  \n*Date: 27 Nov 2025*",
