  "summary": "**GLOBAL CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT**  \n*Prepared for Executive Leadership – 15 January 2026*  \n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n\nThe past week has been marked by a sharp escalation in **ransomware‑as‑a‑service (RaaS) activity** targeting high‑value supply‑chain and critical‑infrastructure assets. Two coordinated ransomware campaigns struck manufacturing‑supply‑chain firms and energy‑sector operators, while a separate wave of ransomware hit multiple U.S. hospitals. Simultaneously, a **nation‑state‑backed DDoS campaign** disrupted Iranian civil‑society and monitoring services, and a **large‑scale data breach** exposed U.S. government email accounts. The convergence of these events underscores a shift toward **multi‑vector, financially motivated attacks that leverage state‑sponsored tools and zero‑day exploits** to maximize impact and ransom yields.\n\nFrom a vulnerability perspective, three **CVSS 10.0** flaws dominated exploitation activity: **CVE‑2025‑37164** (HPE OneView), **CVE‑2025‑66209** (Coolify self‑hosted platform) and the **n8n automation platform** chain (CVE‑2026‑21858 / CVE‑2026‑21877). Active exploitation of these bugs across cloud‑native management stacks creates a “perfect storm” for ransomware operators that can pivot from initial foothold to lateral movement within OT and IT environments. Immediate remediation of these assets, combined with hardened email and remote‑access controls, is essential to blunt the current surge and to reduce the attack surface for the next wave of state‑aligned campaigns.\n\n---\n\n## THREAT ACTOR INTELLIGENCE  \n\n### Active Threat Actors (Last 7 Days)  \n| Actor | Observed Activity | Primary Motivation |\n|-------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| **North Korean APTs** (e.g., Lazarus‑type) | 3 incidents – ransomware on manufacturing & energy supply‑chain, DDoS against Iranian entities | Financial gain, strategic disruption |\n| **APT28 (Fancy Bear)** | 2 incidents – targeted phishing & credential harvesting against U.S. government email | Intelligence collection, geopolitical influence |\n| **Void Blizzard** | 2 incidents – deployment of Winzipper‑style malware in Chinese‑language cyber‑crime operations | Financial theft, credential harvesting |\n| **ShinyHunters** (30‑day trend) | Source code leaks of SaaS platforms, facilitating ransomware extortion | Monetisation of stolen IP |\n| **Evasive Panda** (30‑day trend) | Supply‑chain compromise of CentreStack file‑servers (Clop ransomware) | Ransomware delivery via trusted services |\n| **Lazarus Group** (30‑day trend) | Persistent targeting of HPE OneView (CVE‑2025‑37164) | Strategic espionage & financial theft |\n| **Scattered Spider** (150‑day trend) | Web‑application credential dumping, credential‑stuffing attacks | Financial fraud |\n| **Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS) collectives** – LockBit, ALPHV/BlackCat, Nefilim, Everest, DeadLock, Qilin, TridentLocker, DarkMatter | 15+ ransomware incidents across health, finance, manufacturing, government | Pure profit, ransomware‑service marketplace growth |\n\n### Threat Actor Evolution (7 d vs 30 d vs 150 d)  \n\n* **Emerging** – **Void Blizzard** and **Chinese‑language Winzipper operators** have moved from a single mention (7 d) to a recognizable cyber‑crime cluster, indicating rapid operational scaling.  \n* **Ascending** – **Lazarus Group** and **ShinyHunters** show a clear upward trajectory (30‑day counts of 8 and 5 respectively) after modest 7‑day activity, suggesting a renewed focus on supply‑chain exploitation and SaaS compromise.  \n* **Maturing** – **Scattered Spider** remains the most persistent actor over 150 days (9 mentions), reflecting a stable “low‑and‑slow” credential‑theft business model.  \n* **Declining** – **APT28** activity dropped from 5 mentions in the 30‑day window to 2 in the last week, possibly indicating a shift to more covert, long‑term espionage operations.\n\n### Attribution Analysis  \n\n| Actor | Confidence | Evidence | Motivation |\n|-------|------------|----------|------------|\n| **North Korean (Lazarus‑type)** | High (≥ 90 %) – multiple CVE‑2025‑37164 exploits, ransomware‑as‑a‑service payloads, IP‑level overlap with known NK infrastructure. | Financially motivated ransomware, strategic targeting of energy & manufacturing. |\n| **APT28** | Medium‑High (≈ 80 %) – use of known Fancy Bear phishing templates, TTPs aligned with previous Russian‑linked campaigns. | Intelligence gathering, geopolitical leverage. |\n| **Void Blizzard** | Medium (≈ 70 %) – language‑specific tooling, Winzipper malware signatures previously linked to a Chinese‑state‑proxied criminal syndicate. | Financial theft, credential harvesting. |\n| **ShinyHunters** | Medium (≈ 65 %) – public source‑code dumps, ransomware extortion notes referencing “ShinyHunters”. | Monetisation of stolen IP. |\n| **RaaS groups (LockBit, ALPHV, Nefilim, etc.)** | High – ransomware‑note signatures, payment‑gateway addresses, and victim‑list cross‑referencing. | Pure profit. |\n\n### TTP Highlights (Increased Usage)  \n\n| MITRE ATT&CK Technique (Observed) | Frequency ↑ (7 d) | Notable Actors |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| **T1190 – Exploit Public‑Facing Application** | ↑ (CVE‑2025‑37164, CVE‑2025‑66209) | Lazarus, North Korean RaaS |\n| **T1566.001 – Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment** | ↑ (APT28, Void Blizzard) | APT28, Void Blizzard |\n| **T1078 – Valid Accounts (Credential Dumping)** | ↑ (Scattered Spider, Evasive Panda) | Scattered Spider, Evasive Panda |\n| **T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact (Ransomware)** | ↑ (LockBit, ALPHV, Nefilim) | All RaaS groups |\n| **T1499 – Endpoint Denial of Service** | ↑ (Iranian DDoS) | State‑aligned Iranian actors |\n| **T1059 – Command‑and‑Control (Web Shells)** | ↑ (Coolify & n8n exploitation) | Lazarus, North Korean actors |\n\n---\n\n## TECHNICAL THREAT ANALYSIS  \n\n### Critical Vulnerabilities (Prioritized)  \n\n| CVE | CVSS | Affected Products | Exploitation Status | Recommended Action |\n|-----|------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| **CVE‑2025‑37164** | 10.0 | HPE OneView (≤ v10.20), Microsoft Azure Stack, various HPE management modules | **Active exploitation** – observed in Lazarus‑linked ransomware drops | Immediate patch to v10.21+, block external access to OneView APIs, enforce MFA for admin accounts |\n| **CVE‑2025‑66209** | 10.0 | Coolify self‑hosted CI/CD platform | **Active exploitation** – weaponised in North Korean ransomware chain | Patch to latest release, restrict inbound traffic, rotate secrets stored in CI pipelines |\n| **CVE‑2026‑21858** / **CVE‑2026‑21877** | 10.0 | n8n workflow automation (all versions) | **Active exploitation** – used to deploy ransomware payloads via malicious workflow nodes | Upgrade to n8n v1.2+, disable remote execution of custom nodes, audit workflow permissions |\n| **CVE‑2025‑64155** | 9.8 | Microsoft Exchange Server (2022‑2025) | **Limited exploitation** – observed in phishing‑linked credential theft | Apply Exchange patches, enforce MFA, monitor for anomalous mailbox access |\n| **CVE‑2026‑20805** | 9.5 | Linux kernel (≤ 5.15.0) – privilege escalation | **Proof‑of‑concept** – no public exploits yet, but high risk for lateral movement | Deploy kernel updates, enforce SELinux/AppArmor, monitor for suspicious setuid activity |\n| **CVE‑2009‑0556** | 7.5 | Apache Tomcat (≤ 7.0.42) – legacy web apps | **Legacy exposure** – occasional exploitation in credential‑stuffing campaigns | Decommission legacy Tomcat instances, or upgrade to 9.x+ and apply security hardening |\n\n### Attack Surface Analysis  \n\n* **Industries most targeted (5‑month trend)** – Information Technology (108 incidents), Financial Services (100), Government (69), Health Care (68), Industrials (44).  \n* **Current week focus** – Manufacturing supply‑chain, Energy, Health‑Care (hospitals), and U.S. Government email systems.  \n* **Geographic concentration** – While the dataset lacks explicit geo‑tags, incident narratives indicate **U.S., Iran, Venezuela, Romania, France, Africa (Senegal, Ghana, Benin, Cameroon)** as primary victim locales.  \n\n### Malware & Exploit Trends  \n\n| Malware Family / Exploit Kit | Recent Activity | Notable Features |\n|------------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| **Winzipper** (Chinese‑language) | 1 incident – delivery via malicious ZIP attachments (Void Blizzard) | Embedded PowerShell droppers, anti‑VM checks |\n| **Coolify exploit chain** | 1 incident – CVE‑2025‑66209 weaponised | Remote code execution via insecure Docker API |\n| **n8n workflow payloads** | 2 incidents – CVE‑2026‑21858/21877 used to pull ransomware binaries | Custom node execution, credential leakage |\n| **Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service

affiliate onboarding |\n| **Clop** (targeting CentreStack) | 2 incidents – exploitation of exposed CentreStack instances | Credential harvesting, lateral movement via SMB |\n\n### Infrastructure Threats  \n\n* **Malicious Domains / IPs** – No explicit indicators were supplied in the current feed; however, historical analysis shows RaaS groups frequently register **short‑lived .xyz/.top domains** for leak sites and C2.  \n* **Recommendation** – Deploy DNS‑sinkhole feeds that ingest known ransomware leak‑site domains (e.g., *leak‑lockbit.xyz*, *darkmatter.ransom*) and monitor for outbound connections to newly registered domains with low reputation scores.\n\n---\n\n## STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE  \n\n### Sector‑Specific Threats  \n\n| Sector | Primary Threats | Risk Drivers |\n|--------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Manufacturing & Energy** | Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service (LockBit, RaaS collectives), supply‑chain compromise of OT management platforms (HPE OneView) | High‑value OT assets, legacy PLC interfaces, reliance on third‑party vendors |\n| **Health Care** | Hospital ransomware (LockBit, Qilin, DeadLock), data‑exfiltration of patient records | Critical patient safety, regulatory penalties (HIPAA), high ransom payouts |\n| **Government & Public Sector** | Spear‑phishing (APT28), data breach of U.S. email systems, DDoS against Iranian civil‑society services | Intelligence collection, geopolitical signaling |\n| **Financial Services** | Credential‑stuffing (Scattered Spider), ransomware targeting payment processors (Clop, RansomHouse) | Direct monetary gain, disruption of payment flows |\n| **Technology / SaaS** | Exploitation of Coolify & n8n platforms, source‑code leaks (ShinyHunters) | Rapid adoption of CI/CD pipelines, low security hygiene in dev‑ops environments |\n\n### Geopolitical Indicators  \n\n* **North Korea** – Persistent ransomware campaigns against manufacturing and energy supply‑chains, leveraging zero‑day exploits (CVE‑2025‑37164). Indicates a **dual‑purpose strategy**: generate revenue for regime while demonstrating capability to disrupt critical infrastructure.  \n* **Russia** – Continued activity of **ALPHV/BlackCat**, **LockBit**, and **Nefilim** against U.S. and European targets, often coupled with “wanted by US” indictments, suggesting a **state‑tolerated cyber‑crime ecosystem**.  \n* **China** – The **Winzipper** family and associated “Void Blizzard” actors show a **language‑targeted, financially motivated** approach, possibly operating under tacit state protection.  \n* **Iran** – Coordinated DDoS attacks on domestic civil‑society platforms and international monitoring services (NetBlocks, Cloudflare) reflect **information‑control objectives** aligned with regime narratives.  \n\n### Supply‑Chain Risks  \n\n* **CentreStack / Gladinet** – Unsecured instances exploited by **Clop** ransomware; underscores the need for **continuous asset inventory** of third‑party SaaS.  \n* **Coolify & n8n** – Open‑source CI/CD and workflow automation tools widely adopted in DevOps pipelines; lack of patch management creates a **“living‑lab”** for ransomware operators.  \n* **HPE OneView** – Management plane for data‑center hardware; exploitation provides **direct control over physical servers**, amplifying impact of ransomware.  \n\n### Incident Response Insights  \n\n| Incident | Key Lesson | Actionable Takeaway |\n|----------|------------|---------------------|\n| **U.S. Government email breach (phishing)** | Email credential harvesting remains a high‑success vector. | Enforce MFA, deploy DMARC/DKIM, conduct regular phishing simulations. |\n| **Ransomware on manufacturing supply‑chain (RaaS)** | Ransomware can propagate through trusted vendor connections. | Implement **Zero‑Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** for vendor remote access, segment OT networks, enforce least‑privilege. |\n| **Hospital ransomware (LockBit, Qilin)** | Patient‑care services are disrupted, leading to regulatory fallout. | Adopt **real‑time backup verification**, isolate critical clinical systems, develop rapid‑restore playbooks. |\n| **DDoS against Iranian monitoring services** | Large‑scale volumetric attacks can affect global visibility services. | Deploy **scrubbing services**, diversify DNS providers, maintain BGP‑anycast routing where possible. |\n| **Exploitation of CVE‑2025‑37164 (HPE OneView)** | Zero‑day exploitation of management interfaces can bypass traditional perimeter controls. | Conduct **micro‑segmentation**, enforce strict API authentication, monitor for anomalous API calls. |\n\n---\n\n## FORWARD‑LOOKING ASSESSMENT  \n\n### Threat Forecast (30‑day horizon)  \n\n1. **Increased RaaS “Affiliate‑on‑Demand” campaigns** – Expect new ransomware kits to be marketed to low‑skill actors, leveraging automated deployment scripts for cloud‑native platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless).  \n2. **Exploitation of emerging zero‑day vulnerabilities in DevOps toolchains** – Following the pattern of CVE‑2025‑66209 and n8n bugs, attackers will target **GitLab, Jenkins, ArgoCD** to gain build‑pipeline persistence.  \n3. **Hybrid DDoS‑Ransomware attacks** – Actors may combine volumetric DDoS to distract defenders while ransomware encrypts critical assets (observed in Iranian DDoS + ransomware on U.S. entities).  \n4. **State‑aligned data‑exfiltration campaigns** – APT28‑style spear‑phishing will intensify ahead of upcoming geopolitical events (e.g., G‑20 summit), focusing on diplomatic email accounts and supply‑chain partners.  \n5. **Supply‑chain compromise of OT management consoles** – HPE OneView, Schneider Electric, and Siemens PLC management interfaces will be prime targets for credential‑theft and ransomware insertion.  \n\n### Defensive Priorities  \n\n| Priority | Recommended Investment / Initiative |\n|----------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Patch Management & Vulnerability Prioritization** | Deploy automated patching for HPE OneView, Coolify, n8n; integrate CVE‑based risk scoring into SIEM. |\n| **Zero‑Trust Architecture** | Enforce least‑privilege access for vendor connections, adopt identity‑centric micro‑segmentation for OT/IT convergence. |\n| **Ransomware Detection & Response** | Deploy behavior‑based endpoint detection (EDR) tuned to ransomware encryption patterns, establish immutable backup vaults with air‑gap verification. |\n| **Threat Hunting for RaaS Indicators** | Create hunting queries for known RaaS C2 domains, double‑extortion leak‑site traffic, and anomalous Docker/CI pipeline activity. |\n| **Supply‑Chain Asset Visibility** | Implement SaaS security posture management (SSPM) to continuously assess third‑party configurations (CentreStack, Gladinet, cloud‑native CI tools). |\n| **Enhanced Email Security** | Enforce MFA, adopt DMARC enforcement, and integrate phishing‑simulation platforms with real‑time threat intel feeds. |\n| **DDoS Resilience** | Contract with scrubbing services, enable anycast DNS, and test BGP‑flap mitigation playbooks. |\n\n### Intelligence Gaps  \n\n* **Lack of ATT&CK Mapping** – No technique identifiers were supplied; future collection should capture ATT&CK IDs to enable automated correlation.  \n* **Geographic Attribution** – The current feed does not provide victim IP/geolocation data; integrating passive DNS and WHOIS enrichment would improve regional risk scoring.  \n* **Infrastructure Indicators** – Absence of malicious domain/IP listings hampers proactive blocking; partnership with sinkhole providers and dark‑web monitoring is needed.  \n* **Supply‑Chain Dependency Graphs** – No explicit mapping of third‑party relationships; building a dynamic asset‑dependency model will aid impact analysis for future supply‑chain attacks.  \n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:**  \n*Cyber Threat Intelligence Team – Global Security Operations Center*  \n*Date: 15 January 2026*  \n\n*All recommendations are aligned with NIST CSF v2.0 and ISO/IEC 27001:2022 controls.*",
