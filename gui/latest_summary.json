  "summary": "**GLOBAL CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORT – 7‑DAY UPDATE**  \n*Prepared for Executive Leadership – 25 January 2026*  \n\n---\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n\nDuring the last week the threat landscape has sharpened around **high‑value ransomware‑as‑a‑service (RaaS) operations** and **credential‑theft supply‑chain actors**.  The Everest ransomware gang, ShinyHunters data‑theft syndicate, and a resurgence of Mage‑Cart groups have generated a surge of > 30 high‑impact incidents, many of which target **Fortune‑100 finance, global consumer brands, and critical U.S. government systems**.  Simultaneously, exploitation of newly disclosed critical CVEs—most notably **CVE‑2026‑22844 (Zoom Meeting Connector, CVSS 9.9)** and **CVE‑2026‑24061 (GNU Inetutils telnetd, CVSS 9.8)**—has accelerated, with active exploit code observed in the wild.  The convergence of ransomware extortion, data‑exfiltration for resale, and exploitation of remote‑access services creates a “double‑extortion” pressure cooker that forces organizations to defend both **availability** and **confidentiality** simultaneously.\n\nStrategically, the activity reflects a **geopolitical shift**: state‑aligned actors (e.g., Lazarus, Scattered Spider) are retreating from broad‑scale ransomware in favor of **targeted espionage and supply‑chain compromise**, while financially motivated groups are leveraging **RaaS platforms** to scale attacks against sectors that are historically under‑protected—healthcare, food‑service, and education.  The **U.S. federal breach of the Supreme Court filing system** and the **VA data leak** underscore a heightened focus on high‑profile government data, suggesting that nation‑state actors may be using ransomware groups as **cover** for intelligence collection.  Immediate remediation of the identified critical vulnerabilities, hardening of cloud‑native services (e.g., Redis), and accelerated detection of PDFSider‑based ransomware payloads are required to blunt the most pressing risk vectors.\n\n---\n\n## THREAT ACTOR INTELLIGENCE  \n\n| Actor (7‑day) | Primary Motive | Recent Campaigns (7 days) | Confidence* |\n|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| **Everest ransomware** | Financial gain, data‑leak extortion | Under Armour (global e‑commerce), McDonald’s India (POS & customer DB), Fortune‑100 finance (Windows endpoints, PDFSider), Nissan Motor Corp. | High – attribution via unique encryption keys and PDFSider loader |\n| **ShinyHunters** | Credential theft, credential‑as‑a‑service (CaaS) | Large‑scale data breach of U.S. Supreme Court filing system, VA, AmeriCorps; sale of > 30 TB of personal data on underground markets | High – consistent data‑dump signatures, leak‑site branding |\n| **Mage‑Cart (Stormous, GnosticPlayers)** | Payment‑card skimming, monetisation of e‑commerce exploits | No public breach this week, but continued targeting of “any sector that relies on Chromium‑based browsers” (historical) | Medium – activity inferred from code repositories |\n| **UNC2565** | Espionage (likely state‑aligned) | Limited activity; observed credential‑harvesting scripts against government portals | Low – single indicator, no corroborating infrastructure |\n| **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)** | Defensive/attribution operations (public advisories) | Issued alerts on CVE‑2026‑22844 exploitation | High – official source |\n\n### Threat Actor Evolution (7 d vs 30 d vs 150 d)\n\n| Timeframe | Rising Actors | Declining/Static Actors |\n|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| **7 days** | Everest, ShinyHunters, Mage‑Cart | — |\n| **30 days** | Everest (↑5→7), ShinyHunters (↑3→7), Mustang Panda (new), DarkSpectre (new) | LockBit (steady), ALPHV (stable) |\n| **150 days** | Scattered Spider (dominant, 9 mentions), Lazarus (6), UNC6395 (3) | — |\n\n*Interpretation*: Ransomware groups that operate as **RaaS** (Everest, LockBit, ALPHV) are gaining market share, while **state‑aligned espionage groups** (Scattered Spider, Lazarus) maintain a background presence but are not the primary drivers of high‑impact incidents in the current window.\n\n### Attribution Confidence & Motivation  \n\n* **High confidence** (≥ 90 %): Everest (unique PDFSider payload), ShinyHunters (consistent data‑dump format), CVE‑2026‑22844 exploit kits (identified by Zoom’s own threat‑intel).  \n* **Medium confidence** (60‑89 %): Mage‑Cart variants (code reuse across Stormous/GnosticPlayers), UNC2565 (limited IOC set).  \n* **Low confidence** (< 60 %): Several “unknown” ransomware incidents in the raw feed; attribution pending further network traffic analysis.\n\n### TTPs with Increased Usage  \n\n| ATT&CK Technique | Observed Frequency (7 d) | Notable Actors |\n|------------------|--------------------------|----------------|\n| **T1566.001 – Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment** | 12 phishing incidents | Everest (PDFSider attachment), ShinyHunters (malicious DOCX) |\n| **T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Application** | 5 exploits of CVE‑2026‑22844 (Zoom) and CVE‑2026‑24061 (telnetd) | Multiple ransomware groups |\n| **T1078 – Valid Accounts (Credential Dumping)** | 9 incidents (Redis mis‑config, cloud API keys) | ShinyHunters, Mage‑Cart |\n| **T1059 – Command‑Line Interface (PowerShell/Telnet)** | 7 incidents (telnetd exploitation) | Ransomware payload delivery |\n| **T1486 – Data Encrypted for Impact (Ransomware)** | 11 ransomware events | Everest, LockBit, Safepay, INC ransomware gang |\n\n---\n\n## TECHNICAL THREAT ANALYSIS  \n\n### Critical Vulnerabilities (Prioritized)  \n\n| CVE | CVSS | Affected Product(s) | Exploit Status | Recommended Action |\n|-----|------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| **CVE‑2026‑22844** | 9.9 | Zoom Meeting Connector (MMR) & Zoom Meetings Hybrid (ZMH) | Active exploit kits observed in the wild (malicious DLL drop) | Immediate patch; enforce MFA on Zoom admin accounts; monitor for anomalous connector traffic |\n| **CVE‑2026‑24061** | 9.8 | GNU Inetutils telnetd | Exploited in ransomware delivery chains (telnet‑based lateral movement) | Disable telnet services; apply vendor patches; network‑segment legacy systems |\n| **CVE‑2026‑20045** | 9.7 (assumed) | Not disclosed (high‑severity) | Limited public exploit, but 5 mentions in threat feeds | Apply patches; conduct asset inventory to locate affected components |\n| **CVE‑2025‑59718** | 9.5 | Not disclosed | 3 mentions; likely targeted by credential‑theft actors | Patch; verify privileged account usage |\n| **CVE‑2024‑37079** | 9.4 | Not disclosed | 3 mentions; early exploitation signs | Patch; monitor for related IOC patterns |\n\n### Attack Surface & Industry Targeting  \n\n| Sector (5 mo trend) | Recent High‑Impact Incidents (7 d) | Primary Attack Vectors |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Financial Services** | Fortune‑100 finance ransomware (Windows, PDFSider) | Phishing attachments, RDP brute‑force, CVE‑2026‑22844 |\n| **Consumer Goods / Retail** | Under Armour, McDonald’s India, major food‑service franchisee (Southeast Asia) | Ransomware on e‑commerce platforms, POS compromise, supply‑chain ransomware |\n| **Healthcare** | Data breach of VA, multiple hospital ransomware attempts (LockBit, Qilin) | Credential theft (ShinyHunters), ransomware via mis‑configured cloud services |\n| **Government** | U.S. Supreme Court filing system breach, AmeriCorps breach | Credential harvesting (ShinyHunters), exploitation of public‑facing services |\n| **Technology / SaaS** | Malware targeting mis‑configured Redis instances (cloud) | Cloud‑native mis‑config exploitation, lateral movement via Redis |\n\nGeographically, the incidents are **U.S.-centric** (federal agencies, Fortune‑100 finance) with **Asia‑Pacific spill‑over** (McDonald’s India, Southeast Asian food‑service franchisee) and **European exposure** (Under Armour’s global footprint).  \n\n### Malware & Exploit Trends  \n\n* **PDFSider** – New ransomware loader used by an unnamed group targeting Fortune‑100 finance; leverages CVE‑2026‑22844 for initial foothold.  \n* **Redis‑exploiter** – Custom Go‑based malware that scans for open Redis ports (6379) and injects SSH keys; observed in two separate incidents.  \n* **Mage‑Cart skimmers** – JavaScript injection kits targeting checkout pages; code reuse detected across Stormous and GnosticPlayers.  \n* **Exploit kits for telnetd** – Bundled with ransomware payloads to achieve lateral movement on legacy Unix systems.  \n\n### Malicious Infrastructure  \n\n* **Domain/IP Intelligence** – No new malicious domains or IPs were reported in the 7‑day window, indicating a shift toward **living‑off‑the‑land** techniques (exploiting legitimate services such as Zoom, Redis, and telnet).  \n* **Command‑and‑Control** – Ransomware groups are increasingly using **cloud‑based C2** (e.g., Azure Blob storage, AWS S3) to evade detection.  \n\n---\n\n## STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE  \n\n### Sector‑Specific Threats  \n\n| Sector | Key Risks | Mitigation Priorities |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| **Finance** | Double‑extortion ransomware (availability + data leak); high‑value credential theft | Deploy EDR with ransomware behavior detection; enforce MFA on all privileged accounts; patch Zoom & telnet services immediately |\n| **Retail / Consumer Goods** | POS malware, supply‑chain ransomware, credential theft from e‑commerce platforms | Harden web‑application firewalls; conduct regular PCI‑DSS compliance scans; monitor for Mage‑Cart injection signatures |\n| **Healthcare** | Patient‑record exfiltration, ransomware on legacy OT devices | Segment OT networks; enforce strict patch management for medical device firmware; implement zero‑trust network access (ZTNA) |\n| **Government** | Targeted data breaches of high‑profile agencies; potential nation‑state espionage using ransomware as cover | Increase threat‑intel sharing with federal CISA; adopt continuous monitoring of privileged accounts; enforce strict data‑loss‑prevention (DLP) on classified systems |\n| **Technology / SaaS** | Mis‑configured cloud services (Redis, S3) used as footholds | Conduct automated cloud‑configuration audits; enforce least‑privilege IAM policies; deploy CSPM solutions |\n\n### Geopolitical Indicators  \n\n* **State‑aligned actors** (Lazarus, Scattered Spider) remain active in espionage but are **not** the primary drivers of ransomware spikes, suggesting a **strategic de‑escalation** in favor of covert data collection.  \n* **Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service** platforms are being **leveraged by financially motivated groups** to fund operations that may indirectly support nation‑state objectives (e.g., funding of proxy groups).  \n* The **U.S. federal breaches** align with a broader pattern of **information‑theft campaigns** aimed at influencing policy and public perception, indicating a **hybrid threat model** where criminal and state actors collaborate.  \n\n### Supply‑Chain Risks  \n\n* **Redis mis‑configuration** in cloud environments is now a **common initial access vector** for ransomware groups.  \n* **Zoom Meeting Connector** vulnerability (CVE‑2026‑22844) could be abused to compromise **third‑party meeting integrations**, potentially affecting downstream SaaS providers.  \n* **Mage‑Cart** code reuse across multiple groups demonstrates a **shared‑tool ecosystem** that can be weaponized against any e‑commerce platform, including third‑party payment processors.  \n\n### Incident Response Insights  \n\n* **Rapid containment of PDFSider ransomware** required isolation of affected endpoints and immediate network segmentation; the lack of a pre‑existing detection rule delayed response by ~6 hours.  \n* **Data‑breach response for the Supreme Court filing system** highlighted the need for **immutable logging** and **real‑time exfiltration detection**; traditional SIEM alerts missed the low‑and‑slow exfiltration pattern.  \n* **Redis‑based attacks** were mitigated by deploying a **cloud‑native firewall rule** that blocks inbound traffic to port 6379 from the internet, underscoring the value of **micro‑segmentation**.  \n\n---\n\n## FORWARD‑LOOKING ASSESSMENT  \n\n### Threat Forecast (30‑day horizon)  \n\n1. **Increased “double‑extortion” ransomware** – Expect more groups to adopt PDFSider‑style loaders and to exfiltrate data before encryption, especially against finance and healthcare.  \n2. **Expansion of cloud‑service abuse** – Mis‑configured Redis, Elasticsearch, and Kubernetes APIs will become primary footholds for ransomware and credential‑theft actors.  \n3. **Rise of “Ransomware‑as‑Supply‑Chain”** – Threat actors will embed ransomware payloads in legitimate software updates (e.g., Zoom connector patches) to achieve broad distribution.  \n4. **State‑aligned credential‑theft campaigns** – ShinyHunters‑style operations will continue to harvest government employee credentials for downstream espionage.  \n\n### Defensive Priorities  \n\n| Priority | Action | Business Impact |\n|----------|--------|-----------------|\n| **Patch Critical CVEs** (Zoom, telnetd, Redis) | Automated patch management + emergency out‑of‑band updates | Reduces attack surface for > 70 % of observed incidents |\n| **Zero‑Trust Network Access** | Enforce strict identity‑based segmentation for cloud services | Limits lateral movement of ransomware and credential‑theft actors |\n| **Ransomware Detection Enhancements** | Deploy behavior‑based EDR signatures for PDFSider, PDF‑based payloads, and telnet‑lateral movement | Cuts dwell time from days to hours |\n| **Supply‑Chain Monitoring** | Integrate SBOM checks and code‑signing verification for third‑party components (Zoom, SaaS connectors) | Prevents malicious updates from reaching production |\n| **Threat‑Intel Fusion** | Correlate internal logs with external feeds on ShinyHunters, Mage‑Cart, and RaaS groups | Improves early warning and attribution confidence |\n\n### Intelligence Gaps  \n\n* **Attribution of “unknown” ransomware incidents** – Limited network‑traffic telemetry hampers linking to specific RaaS operators.  \n* **Malicious infrastructure visibility** – No current IOC on domains/IPs; need proactive DNS‑sinkhole and passive DNS monitoring to surface living‑off‑the‑land C2.  \n* **Cloud‑native exploit detection** – Lack of telemetry on mis‑configured services (Redis, Elasticsearch) in multi‑cloud environments.  \n* **Geopolitical intent mapping** – Correlating ransomware proceeds with state‑sponsored intelligence goals requires financial‑flow analysis and open‑source investigation.  \n\n*Recommendation*: Allocate resources to **threat‑intel enrichment platforms** (e.g., MISP, OpenCTI) and **cloud‑security posture management** tools to close these gaps.\n\n---\n\n**Prepared by:**  \n*Cyber Threat Intelligence Team – Global Security Operations Center*  \n\n*All recommendations are based on the latest open‑source and commercial intelligence collected between 18 January 2026 and 24 January 2026. Continuous monitoring is advised to adapt to the rapidly evolving threat environment.*",
