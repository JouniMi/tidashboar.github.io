  "summary": "**Cyber‑Threat Intelligence Report – Energy Sector**  \n*Coverage period: 30 days (23 Dec 2025 – 02 Jan 2026)*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Executive Summary  \n\nThe past month has been marked by a **convergence of OT‑focused threat activity and broad‑based cyber‑crime campaigns** that are increasingly spilling over into the energy domain.  Two high‑profile incidents dominate the sector picture:\n\n* **Ransomware attack on Romania’s Oltenia Energy Complex** – a large‑scale disruption of a critical‑generation plant that forced an emergency shutdown of several turbines and highlighted the vulnerability of legacy OT environments.  \n* **Leak of utility‑specific infrastructure data** – a threat‑actor advertised detailed schematics of three U.S. electric utilities for sale, underscoring the growing market for “utility‑intel” on the dark web.\n\nThese events sit alongside **cross‑industry exploit trends** (e.g., active exploitation of FortiOS SSL‑VPN 2FA bypass, MongoDB “MongoBleed” CVE‑2025‑14847, and supply‑chain attacks on npm packages) that are directly relevant to energy operators that rely on the same commercial products and cloud‑native stacks.  The overall threat landscape is therefore **highly opportunistic**, with nation‑state and financially‑motivated actors leveraging widely‑available exploits to target the high‑value, high‑availability environment of power generation, transmission, and distribution.\n\n**Key take‑aways**\n\n| Threat pattern | Strategic implication for Energy |\n|----------------|---------------------------------|\n| **Ransomware on OT/ICS** (Oltenia) | Demonstrates that attackers can breach plant‑level networks, halt generation, and demand large ransoms; highlights need for air‑gap validation, network segmentation, and rapid incident‑response playbooks. |\n| **Utility‑specific data for sale** | Threat‑actors are commoditising grid‑topology and SCADA configuration data, enabling pre‑attack reconnaissance and tailored weaponisation. |\n| **Active exploitation of common infra (FortiOS, MongoDB, Digiever NVR)** | Energy firms using these products are at immediate risk of remote code execution and credential theft; patching and configuration hardening are urgent. |\n| **Supply‑chain attacks via npm / Shai‑Hulud** | Modern energy‑software stacks (e.g., data‑ingestion pipelines, edge analytics) that depend on open‑source JavaScript libraries are exposed to malicious code injection. |\n| **Kernel‑mode rootkits (Mustang Panda, HoneyMyte)** | Advanced APTs are capable of persisting in the kernel of Windows‑based OT workstations, bypassing traditional AV and EDR. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Threat Actor Intelligence  \n\n| Actor / Campaign | Motivation & Targeting | Energy‑specific Activity | Notable TTPs |\n|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|\n| **Mustang Panda / HoneyMyte (Chinese‑linked APT)** | State‑sponsored espionage, long‑term persistence in critical infrastructure. | No direct Energy‑specific incident in the 30‑day window, but the group’s **kernel‑mode rootkit driver** (see *“Mustang Panda deploys ToneShell via signed kernel‑mode rootkit driver”* – SecurityAffairs, 30 Dec 2025) is a proven method for compromising Windows‑based OT workstations used in many power plants. | Signed driver abuse, kernel‑mode backdoor (ToneShell), stealth persistence. |\n| **Shai‑Hulud supply‑chain (npm) actors** | Financially‑motivated cyber‑crime, targeting crypto wallets and any software that pulls dependencies from npm. | Energy‑related software pipelines that use npm (e.g., web‑based HMI dashboards, data‑visualisation tools) could be compromised (see *“Researchers Spot Modified Shai‑Hulud Worm Testing Payload on npm Registry”* – The Hacker News, 31 Dec 2025). | Malicious npm package injection, supply‑chain compromise, credential theft. |\n| **Ransomware groups (e.g., unnamed ransomware gang behind Oltenia attack)** | Financial extortion; opportunistic targeting of high‑value OT environments. | **Oltenia Energy Complex ransomware** (SecurityAffairs, 29 Dec 2025) – attackers gained lateral movement into plant control networks, encrypted SCADA data, and demanded a multi‑million‑dollar ransom. | Phishing/email attachment, credential dumping, lateral movement via VPN, encryption of OT data. |\n| **Dark market “Utility‑Intel” seller** | Monetisation of stolen infrastructure data. | **Utility infrastructure files for sale** (The Register, 02 Jan 2026) – schematics, network diagrams, and credential dumps for three major U.S. utilities. | Data exfiltration, resale on underground forums, potential for pre‑attack reconnaissance. |\n| **Evasive Panda (DNS‑poisoning campaign)** | Broad‑range espionage, targeting IoT and industrial devices. | While not Energy‑specific, the **DNS poisoning delivering MgBot** (The Hacker News, 26 Dec 2025) can affect IoT sensors and edge devices deployed in substations. | DNS cache poisoning, malware dropper (MgBot), IoT botnet formation. |\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- **State‑aligned APTs** (Mustang Panda, Evasive Panda) are refining kernel‑level persistence techniques that are directly applicable to Energy OT.  \n- **Financially‑motivated ransomware** continues to evolve, now capable of breaching air‑gapped plant networks via compromised VPN/remote‑access solutions.  \n- **Data‑theft marketplaces** are emerging as a pre‑recon service for utility operators, increasing the risk of *targeted* attacks.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
